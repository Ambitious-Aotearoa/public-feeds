Unmasking the Hidden Link: Mental Health and Financial Stress,,"As we observe Mental Health Awareness Week, it's crucial to shine a light on a topic that often lurks in the shadows: the profound connection between mental health and financial worries. This intricate relationship is a testament to the complexity of our lives and how seemingly unrelated aspects can significantly impact our well-being. Join us as we delve into the world of mental health, financial stress, and the transformative power of awareness. The Hidden StrugglesMental health challenges know no boundaries, and neither does financial stress. Unfortunately, society's expectations and stereotypes often discourage men from openly discussing their mental health. However, when we explore the interconnectedness of mental health and financial well-being, we uncover an essential narrative:The Silent Burden: Financial stress can be a heavy burden to bear. Whether it's mounting debts, job insecurity, or the pressure to provide for a family, these concerns can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and helplessness.The Masked Emotions: Men, in particular, might feel societal pressure to appear strong and stoic, concealing their emotional turmoil. This can exacerbate mental health issues, as internalizing feelings can lead to isolation and a lack of support.The Stigma Surrounding Seeking Help: Seeking professional help for mental health concerns can be challenging due to the stigma attached to it. When financial stress compounds these issues, it can be even more daunting for men to reach out for assistance. Understanding the ConnectionMental health and financial stress are not separate entities; they are interconnected in profound ways. Acknowledging this connection is crucial for our collective well-being.The Vicious Cycle: Financial stress can lead to mental health issues, and conversely, mental health issues can impact financial decision-making. When overwhelmed by stress and anxiety, individuals may make impulsive financial choices that worsen their financial situation.The Impact on Relationships: Financial stress can strain relationships, causing tension and conflict. This, in turn, can intensify feelings of isolation and loneliness, further affecting mental health.The Workplace: Mental health concerns can lead to decreased productivity at work, absenteeism, and even job loss, exacerbating financial worries. Taking ActionAs we commemorate Mental Health Awareness Week, let's take proactive steps to address these intertwined challenges:Encourage Open Conversations: Promote open dialogues about mental health and financial stress. Encourage men to express their feelings and seek support from friends, family, or mental health professionals.Promote Financial Literacy: Advocate for financial education, providing individuals with the knowledge and tools to make informed financial decisions and mitigate stress.Accessible Mental Health Services: Advocate for accessible and affordable mental health services to ensure that men have the support they need when facing these challenges.Workplace Initiatives: Encourage employers to implement mental health support programs, employee assistance programs, and financial wellness initiatives.Community Support: Foster communities where men can find camaraderie and support, reducing the isolation that often accompanies mental health struggles. Mental Health Awareness Week reminds us that mental health is a universal concern, and financial stress is a significant contributor to the challenges individuals face. By acknowledging the link between mental health and financial worries, we can create a more compassionate and understanding society. It's time to break the silence, debunk stereotypes, and extend a helping hand to men navigating the complex terrain of mental health and financial stress. Together, we can promote wellness, reduce stigma, and support one another on the path to mental and financial well-being. Unsure where to start on your financial journey?

10 Reasons a FoxPlan Financial Plan is for YOU,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/656e0048-8bd3-4d1f-a963-3519f1de3e13/smooth+the+road+.png?format=original,"Why You Should Consider a Financial PlanFinancial planning is the process of taking a comprehensive look at your financial situation and building a specific financial plan to reach your goals. As a result, financial planning often delves into multiple areas of finance, including investing, taxes, savings, retirement, your estate, insurances and more. A financial plan allows you to see the big picture of your finances and any plans you have in mind. A good financial plan includes details about your current situation, short-term goals, long-term goals and how you'll achieve them. Here are ten reasons why we think financial planning – with the help of a professional financial adviser – can help you pursue and reach your goals. Income: It's possible to manage income more effectively through planning. Managing income helps you understand how much money you'll need for payments, other monthly expenditures and savings.Cash Flow: Increase cash flow by carefully monitoring your spending patterns and expenses. Maintaining sensible spending habits and creating a well-managed budget will help you keep more of the money you make.Capital: An increase in cash flow can lead to a rise in the amount of capital you have, which means you'll be able to work towards improving your overall financial well-being and potentially start to consider ing investments Family Security: Providing for your family's financial security is an important part of the financial planning process. Having the proper insurance coverage and policies in place can help create peace of mind for you and your loved ones.Investment: A proper financial plan considers your personal circumstances, objectives and risk tolerance. It acts as a guide in helping choose the right types of investments to fit your needs, personality, and goals.Standard of Living: With proper planning, you can maintain a high quality of life even in times of economic difficulty. For example, you could make sure there is enough insurance coverage to replace any lost income should the household's main earner become unable to work.Financial Understanding: Better financial understanding can be achieved when measurable financial goals are set. It's important to set measurable financial goals, understand the effects of decisions and review your results. This gives you a whole new approach to budgeting and improves control over your financial lifestyleAssets: A nice 'cushion' in the form of assets is desirable. But many assets come with liabilities attached. So, it becomes crucial to determine the real value of an asset. Undertaking this process will help build assets that don't become a burden in the future.Savings: One thing that most people are aware of is the importance of starting to save for your future. It used to be called saving for a rainy day, but sudden financial changes can still throw you off track. It is good to have some investments with high liquidity. These investments can be utilized in times of emergency or for educational purposes. Ongoing Advice: Establishing a relationship with a financial adviser you can trust is crucial to achieving your goals. Your financial adviser will meet with you to assess your current financial circumstances and develop a comprehensive plan customized for you. Financial planning is an ongoing process that can reduce your stress about money, support your current needs and help you build a nest egg for your long-term goals, like retirement.Creating a financial plan is important because it allows you to make the most of your assets, helps ensure you meet your future goals and gives you the confidence to weather any bumps along the way.We help people understand their current financial situation, assist them with knowledge and skills, as well as offer guidance and advice to achieve their short, medium and long-term goals. A total Financial Plan consists of three key areas; control of money, confidence in your investments and certainty of plan B.",,"Sun, 09 Oct 2022 23:41:39 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
How to Build Wealth AND Enjoy Life - Part 1,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/5edf07a9-b687-4564-8726-31bed9f90fbe/Untitled+design+%2840%29.png?format=original,"Building wealth while also enjoying life has always been a hotly debated topic. Whether it is a parent, sibling, or friend, when someone tells you to save, invest, and think smartly about your future, it is typically met with this common objection; “but I’d rather have fun, live my life and spend my money now”. So I say, why not both? The Money Personality SpectrumFirst, we must acknowledge that having both can be very difficult for some. Everyone has their own money personality. On one side of the scale, you’ve got austerity - beyond tight with money and spending money makes their stomach turn. To be so far on this side of the scale means you have an unhealthy relationship with spending and a fear of the long-term outcomes of spending money inappropriately.On the other end of the scale, there is recklessness, where there is absolutely no care or thought whatsoever for spending money. Both of these extremes can be just as damaging to building wealth and having fun at the same time. Both sides of the scale make for bad financial planning. The Dangers of ExtremesYou want to enjoy yourself, especially when you're in your twenties and thirties wanting to eat nice food, do more with your friends, and see more of the world. You should not feel guilty about doing those things, as long as you have got somewhat clear objectives and a clear way forward and how you're going to achieve those longer-term goals. So not jeopardizing the fun, but just having a bit of control. Embracing Enjoyment Without GuiltThe only way to achieve that is by actually sitting down and asking yourself “Can I achieve my important long-term goals and still have fun?”, because if you don't actually ask that question and look at it and figure out what those long-term objectives are, then you are really just guessing and you might guess “No, I can't. So I won't have that fun”. That's just a guess, you have to sit down and get some clarity.Striking a Balance: Long-Term Goals and FunIf you can measure what's coming in, what's going out, where it's actually going, and what you're going to need to be able to achieve those objectives and everything left over, you can allocate towards having fun. But it would be so scary to do that if you didn't know that you could. The Importance of ClarityOnce you know your expenditure, automate your spending so you know what you need and then have your goal accounts for different goals. So you have your travel fund, you have your car fund, whatever it may be, and then you can allocate resources to that and when it comes time to go on that holiday or buy that car, you can spend it without guilt because you know everything else is going to be fine.Delve further into how to build wealth while enjoying your life in our next blog where we will highlight the drawbacks of relying on a single savings account for your many financial goals, stressing the need to create separate accounts to ensure clarity and prevent unexpected setbacks.",,"Thu, 25 Jan 2024 19:41:02 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
Making Sense of Common Finance Terms,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/01ca8daa-8f51-4db2-81da-2d5ea58597ed/Untitled+design+-+2024-03-15T113529.961.png?format=original,"Navigating the world of finance can often feel like deciphering a foreign language, especially when bombarded with complex jargon and acronyms. In this blog, we aim to demystify some of the most commonly used terms, making financial concepts more accessible to everyone. S&P 500: You've probably heard this term thrown around frequently. But what exactly is the S&P 500? Simply put, it's a list of the top 500 companies in the US based on their market capitalisation. Think of it as a barometer for the overall performance of the US stock market. Leverage: When someone mentions leverage, they're essentially talking about using borrowed funds to amplify potential returns. For instance, leveraging equity in your home to invest in additional properties or ventures. Net Worth: Your net worth is a straightforward concept—it's the difference between your assets (what you own) and your liabilities (what you owe). Calculating your net worth provides a snapshot of your financial health. Equity: Equity represents ownership. For example, if you own a property valued at $1 million and have a mortgage of $400,000, your equity in the property is $600,000—the portion you truly own. Asset Allocation: Asset allocation refers to the mix of investments in your portfolio. This mix typically includes stocks, bonds, real estate, and cash. Your asset allocation should align with your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Socially Responsible Investing (SRI): SRI, also known as ethical or sustainable investing, involves selecting investments based on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. This may include excluding companies involved in controversial industries or favoring those with strong sustainability practices. Understanding these fundamental terms can empower individuals to make smarter financial decisions. Whether you're planning for retirement, managing investments, or simply aiming to build wealth, clarity in financial language can pave the way for greater financial literacy and success. Let's break down the barriers of finance jargon and embrace a more accessible approach to wealth management.",,"Fri, 22 Mar 2024 00:01:03 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz

Some of you may recognise my name from recent emails regarding the Consilium Phase 2 changes. I’m excited to be part of your investment experience.Consilium Phase 2 Updates: Smooth Sailing AheadFirst and foremost, thank you to everyone who reached out with feedback and questions. For everyone who confirmed they were happy to make the suggested changes, this has all been taken care of and the timeframes for any trading requests for the accounts involved are expected to be back to normal from the 8th of April 2024. Now, let’s talk about something equally important: financial literacy. As investors, we often find ourselves navigating a complex landscape of jargon, numbers, and market fluctuations. But how well do we truly understand these intricacies? Let’s explore the perception gap—the space between what we think we know and what we actually know. Financial Confidence vs. Financial Literacy: The Kiwi ParadoxThe Financial Services Council (FSC) Research Report 2023Can Kiwis truly feel financially confident amidst a decline in financial literacy? The FSC’s latest research delves into this paradox, revealing a significant gap between perceived financial confidence and actual financial literacy.The Perception GapA staggering 82% of Kiwis report feeling financially confident. However, when it comes to financial literacy, only 47% demonstrate a solid understanding of basic financial concepts. This discrepancy raises important questions about the roots of financial confidence and the reality of financial knowledge among New Zealanders.Financial Trivia vs. Self-PerceptionThe FSC’s approach involved testing actual knowledge through ‘financial trivia’ rather than relying on self-assessment. The findings are telling:Interest Rates vs. Inflation: Only 58% correctly understood that with a savings interest rate lower than inflation, their purchasing power decreases.Investment Diversification: 73% grasped the concept of diversification, recognising that investing in multiple companies is less risky than a single-company investment.Risk vs. Return: A high 90% acknowledged that high returns typically come with high risks.KiwiSaver Fund Options: The knowledge of KiwiSaver funds was less clear-cut, with just over half (57%) understanding that a growth fund entails higher risk compared to a balanced fund. Dissecting the ResultsThe research suggests several potential reasons for the perception gap:Complexity of Financial Products: The financial world’s complexity can lead to misunderstandings, even among those who feel confident.Educational Disparities: Differences in financial education across demographics can lead to varying levels of literacy.Media and Marketing Influence: The portrayal of financial products in media can create false impressions of simplicity and safety.Overconfidence: I’m sure you know what this is well enough.Age and Gender InsightsThe study also confirms that financial literacy tends to improve with age, and women generally outperform men in this area. Notably, 86% of individuals aged 60+ answered three or more questions correctly, compared to only 48% of 29-year-olds. Additionally, 66% of women got three or four questions right, surpassing the 57% of men who did the same.ConclusionThe FSC’s research underscores a clear disconnect between financial confidence and literacy. It’s evident that while many New Zealanders feel confident about their financial acumen, a deeper understanding of financial principles is needed to bridge the perception gap.Bridging the Gap: Empowering OurselvesWhether you’re looking to enhance your own financial literacy and financial plan or know someone who could benefit from having a financial plan and the part investment plays in growing wealth, FoxPlan’s investment seminars are a valuable resource.

Securing Your Child's Future: Building an Education Fund,,"Are you one of the many parents contemplating the financial burden of providing private education for your children? It's a common concern, and rightfully so. The costs associated with primary, intermediate, and tertiary education can be daunting. In this blog, we'll delve into this topic, discussing strategies to ease the financial strain and secure your child's educational future.Let's break down some key points:Understanding the Costs Private education comes with a hefty price tag. From daycare expenses to tertiary education fees, the numbers can quickly add up. For instance, daycare costs alone can amount to around $20,000 per year for a single child.Many parents aspire to financially support their children's education, whether partially or fully. Some opt to cover accommodation expenses, while others commit to funding school fees. Regardless of the approach, meticulous planning is essential.Setting Financial GoalsIt's crucial to establish clear financial goals tailored to your family's circumstances. For example, some parents pledge $20,000 annually for each year of tertiary education. However, it's essential to recognise that the timeframe for meeting these expenses doesn't necessarily align with the start of tertiary education. Start saving or investing years before your children are due to need the money to give yourself a head start and reduce stress.Investment StrategiesInvesting early can significantly alleviate the financial burden. By starting to save as soon as your child is born and consistently contributing a modest amount each week, fortnight or month, you can accumulate a substantial sum over time. For example, setting aside $100 per month with a modest 6% return could yield $46,000 by the time your child turns 20.Taking advantage of compounding interest can amplify your savings over the long term. By investing in diversified portfolios, such as shares, you stand to benefit from historically higher returns compared to traditional savings vehicles like term deposits.Balancing Risks and RewardsWhile term deposits offer stability, they often fail to outpace inflation, resulting in a loss of purchasing power over time (You’ve gained money but things cost more now so you really haven’t). On the other hand, investing in the share market entails higher risk but historically higher returns, especially over extended periods.Long-Term PerspectiveWhen considering investment options, it's crucial to evaluate their alignment with long-term financial goals, such as retirement planning. While short-term fluctuations in the market may be unsettling, maintaining a steadfast approach and focusing on long-term growth potential is key.Building an education fund for your children requires careful consideration, strategic planning, and a long-term perspective. By starting early, setting realistic goals, and leveraging investment opportunities, you can provide your children with the gift of education without sacrificing your financial well-being. Remember, it's never too early to start investing in your child's future.",,"Mon, 19 Feb 2024 01:52:30 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz

5 Tips for Property Investing,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579610252662-S64BPJ5BPTBR8646F3OU/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"If you’re looking to invest in property it’s very important to have an investment strategy. Long term property investing can form part of retirement planning and generally you’ll buy a property and hold for a length of time, paying down debt and gaining passive income over time. Alternatively you can take a short term approach and either buy, renovate and then sell on or hope to buy and sell when the market fluctuates. The short term strategy is about profit taking. With either approach there’s a few things you’ll need to have in place and various checks to perform before investing. Use a property Manager Selecting property management professionals to run your property portfolio is an important decision. Many disillusioned property investors will wax lyrical with anecdotal evidence damning the property sector as a minefield for novice property investors. This is common where investors have rushed in to an investment sector, whether Shares, Bonds, Collectibles, or Property. An important question to answer is: do I attempt to manage the investment myself or do I choose to delegate that responsibility.We are quite clear with our recommendations. Unless you have time to become a professional investor (study the sector, qualify and learn about the ramifications of inappropriate decision making) you should price in the cost of good management advice, then delegate that responsibility. Your choice of manager is critical. Whether fund manager or property manager, good Financial Planners and Mortgage Brokers know who the best professionals are in most investment areas. We certainly do not advocate investing in expensive assets in any sector then managing them in an amateurish fashion. Valuations Kerbside Valuation: often a kerbside valuation will allow sufficient information to discontinue negotiations. It is not expensive and will provide the opportunity to proceed with further more costly reports if the outcome to the kerbside valuation is positive.Registered Valuation, this report will tell you what the house is worth, comparable sales in the area, and may highlight items in need of work with the property. Depending on the level of borrowing, the bank may require a valuation, however even if they don’t it’s a good idea to get one done, to ensure you are not over capitalising by paying too much for the house.Separate Chattel Valuation: when purchasing a property for investment a separate chattel valuation is essential. Depreciation on building and chattels differs. Your accountant will need to be informed of both. This valuation can often be done at the same time as the full valuation, so will keep costs down as you will save the valuer making two trips. Pre-Purchase Checks Land information memorandum report (LIM), a report from the council showing all the things that have been lodged with the council, such as consents, title lodgements etc. This report can take up to 15 working days to be done, which often is much longer than any vendor will allow for conditions. You can either go to the council and look up the records yourself or have them do it for you.Builders report, a building inspection report will tell you if there are any problems with the house, any repairs that need doing, any potential building code violations, and other items of concern. If there are repairs to be done, you can decide to drop your price by enough to cover the repairs, don’t let the vendor do the repairs, make sure it is done by a qualified repairman of your choosing. In addition you can have the builders report give you a list of the items on the lim report, which may eliminate the need for one.Engineers report, the need for one of these reports will likely be indicated by something from the builders report. This report looks more closely at earthworks, and key structural things.Valuation for insuranceChemical residue report Understand the financials The balance sheet and profit and loss statement are critical (make sure the numbers stack up).Combing property investing with long term financial goals – the property investment should complement your financial plan as investing is only one part of total financial planning.You are not overly focused on negative gearing – tax advantages are a bonus.Understanding gross and net yield + return on investment + growth expectationIf your objective is for capital gain rather than yield – do not calculate above a 5% growth (inclusive of inflation)Do Not mix personal and business accounts. Think of the risks Look at risk factors – interest rate movement, rental supply and demand, unplanned maintenance, tenants, vacancy rates, likely demographic changes.Ensure correct ownership structure – to minimise tax, maximise asset protection and ensure complianceUse a team of specialists, before and after you buy.Run as a Business – measure, monitor, and manage.FoxPlan make available their property analysis as part of an overall financial plan.

68% of New Zealanders report money worries,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1582447547010-4LIZ8KI7XRAVU94CF80K/68%25+of+New+Zealanders+report+money+worries+.png?format=original,"68% of New Zealanders report money worriesA few months ago, The Commission for Financial Capability issued its 2017/2018 Annual report. View hereThe Commission, in my opinion one of the great things previous Governments have established & supported, has amongst its key goals, raising the awareness of the value of financial capability across NZ.The 68% of those surveyed being worried about money is a concerning figure given both the reasonably impressive growth in the country’s GDP, combined with low unemployment over the last 8 years. Some sectors have blamed our low wage economy & called for an increase in minimum wages to fix the problem. They rightly point out that our good economic performance has not been shared equally across the community. While few people would doubt that better pay could reduce some money worries I wonder if that alone will solve the problem, or do we also have address lack of basic money skills?When 82% of current secondary school students say they want to learn more about how to manage their money, our next generation of earners will probably also suffer the same worries unless we accept there is a problem and commit to change. Teaching kids the basics of not spending everything they might receive either as pocket money or gifts, but to also to save some. More and more primary schools are signing up to the joint initiative between the great Kiwi designed money software that teaches kids basic money skills, Banqer and its sponsor KiwiBank, to improve things for our 5 to 13 year olds. As adults you too can put aside any embarrassment and ask for help, from someone you know who is financially successful or seek assistance from a financial adviser.

7 Ingredients for a Lifetime of Investing Success,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1583426629899-KHC2E7R0OSO1JB2F4B30/WW.png?format=original,"As the world gets smaller from the perspective of communication, connectivity, instant visibility of events, entertainment, influencers and investments, it can be easy to get confused about how to invest successfully. A plethora of investment options often confuses those without an investment plan and philosophy. This month we look at the 7 simple ingredients for successful planning, a plan that will stand the test of time.1. Regularly invest 7% of your after-tax income.Regularly investing just 7% of your after-tax income will do more for your long-term wealth creation than almost anything else you might get lucky with. If you already contribute 3% to KiwiSaver and your employer matches that at 3%, you are already a long way there. Remember though that your employer’s 3% contribution is taxed.2. Invest throughout your working lifetime.The recipe will only work if you save the 7% throughout your working life. Seemingly normal decisions such as taking money from your investments or KiwiSaver for a first home purchase or stopping contributions during periods of maternity leave will have a dramatic effect on your long-term success. The loss of compound interest from such actions can take 10 or more years of increased savings to catch back up again.3. Invest into equities.You can’t ‘save yourself’ rich. Cash and bonds have never provided the return necessary to outpace the double effects of tax and inflation. This means much of the $170 billion sitting in cash or term deposits in New Zealanders bank accounts, will hinder rather than help these people grow their wealth. Only equities and property have proven track records of outpacing inflation and providing some tax-free returns that will maintain purchasing power and in addition, providing surplus for others.4. Diversification.Investors who literally lost a lot of money, in the recent large market corrections in 1987, 2000, 2008 etc were those who had concentrated their investments in just a few companies, typically less than 50, or one sector of the market such as technology stocks. Those who were well diversified, invested in 8000 or more companies, still suffered short term reductions in wealth but this was quickly returned once the markets corrected.5. Index / Asset Class Funds.While some still debate the relative merits or otherwise of Active funds management versus Index or Passive funds management, empirical evidence shows the latter is superior to the former over the long term. Most Active managers fail to beat the markets they measure themselves against. Plus, Index funds are the easiest, cost effective and most efficient way of diversifying your money across all markets .6. Low Cost. Fund manager fees are one of the greatest drags on investment performance. In addition to the usual fees some Active fund also charge additional fees if their funds achieve a certain percentage return. Isn’t that just their job? On the other hand, Index / Asset class funds which follow an index require less analysts and trade less, thereby reducing costs for investors.7. Be Strategic not Tactical.Those with patience and faith in their long-term strategy tend to be less emotional about their investment decisions and stay the course despite short-term setbacks. Constant, seemingly tactical changes, run the risk of moving you totally off course, add cost and make measuring success more difficult.Unsure if your, or someone you know, plans measure up? Call us for an obligation free review. We can tell you how on track / off track you are and what simple adjustments might enhance your chance of success.Are your investments at danger of catching the Coronavirus?While investments can’t catch the virus, people's emotional reaction to events will likely cause short term volatility in returns. This virus is something new, but people’s reactions to such new viruses is nothing new, nor is our advice to those worried about their investment portfolios. If you are well diversified, have a good cash reserve and understand your long-term strategy then probably nothing needs to change. Typically like the virus, the effects of these events are short lived and those who stay the course are rewarded for keeping their nerve.

The 8 Great Investment Mistakes To Avoid,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1715905152321-L0QAY06C8756AUSEW48E/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"EuphoriaIt is the complete loss of an adult sense of danger. Your only concern is that somebody somewhere owns stocks that are going up more than yours.PanicThere is a consistent relationship between the height of the ""mob's"" euphoria at the top of a big bull market and the depth of their panic-induced capitulation at the bottom of the concomitant bear market. Panic is the pure essence of a loss of faith in the future.LeverageThis is when you borrow money, maybe against your home equity or on margin from a broker, to purchase an investment. In practice, most people borrow at the wrong times and on the wrong terms, in order to buy the wrong things at the wrong times for all the wrong reasons. The loan reduces the investment gain (if there is one) and increases the amount of the investment loss (if there is one). Speculating When You Think You Are InvestingAll short-term trading is speculation, in that fundamental values do not change quickly. An investor is always interested in long-term improvements in earnings, cash flows and dividends. A trader is interested in quick changes in price and is therefore always a speculator.Similarly, all options and all futures contracts are speculation rather than investments because their ending value after expiration is zero.OverdiversificationExample: a person invests once a year and every year they put the new money into the top-performing equity fund on Forbes's Honour Roll. Twelve years later, this person owns a hodgepodge of 12 mutual funds, because-like Miss Universe - nobody wins twice. This will result in an expensive index fund with gaps, redundancies, and fee inefficiencies.Under DiversificationThe fatal narrowing of a portfolio down to essentially one idea. Holding the preponderance of your equity ""portfolio"" in one stock is not investing. It is Russian roulette. Every day when the market opens, you point that gun at your head and pull the trigger in what economists' call ""creative destruction"". Investing For Current Yield Rather Than Total ReturnThis is a mistake made by many retirees.Investments which have the highest current yield (such as interest or dividends) have the lowest total return, while investments with lower current yield (such as interest or dividends) must-in an efficient market-compensate by offering the higher long-term return. The only rational test of an investor's long-term income-producing potential is its long-term total return.Letting Your Cost Basis Dictate Your Investment DecisionsYour cost in an investment has nothing to do with its objective value today. Your investments do not know what you paid for them and would not perform any differently if they did.One way this will show up is the refusal to migrate back toward proper diversification because one very successful investment would, were it sold, generate capital gains taxation. This will then lead to under diversification since that successful investment becomes a greater percentage of the overall portfolio.The other way this will show up is when an investor decides they cannot take the loss on an unsuccessful investment even though the fundamental have completely changed: indeed, no objectively verifiable fact matters.",,"Mon, 20 May 2024 00:11:21 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
3 Quick Wins to Improve Your Financial Situation,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/4225dd33-514b-4612-b4af-c9e2c821dedb/3+Simple+Ways+to+Boost+your+Retirement+Savings+in+2023+%289%29.png?format=original,"Managing your finances doesn’t always have to be complicated. Here are 3 straightforward tips you can put into action to start seeing positive results in your financial life. Quick Win #1: Sleep Better at NightBuild up an emergency fund. It’s a boring one and it can seem counterintuitive to have money sitting in your account that’s not invested, but if you have a minimum of 3 months' worth of your expenses set aside, then when your car needs a new set of tires or you need some dental work, you’re going to be able to draw on that money. Knowing your expenses are covered is going to give you great peace of mind, rather than having to use your investments as a cash account, dip into that, and then have to top it back up. It gets messy. Quick Win #2: Save on Income Protection PremiumsJargon Alert! If you’re not quite sure what income protection is; it is an insurance that covers policyholders who are incapacitated and unable to work due to illness or accident.If you have income protection, you would have had to choose a waiting period which is how long you would have to wait before the benefit starts paying you. The longer the waiting period, the cheaper your insurance premiums are, but on the other hand, the shorter the waiting period you chose, the more expensive your premiums are going to be. So, if you have an emergency fund with 3 months expenses like we talked about in the first quick win, you could effectively reduce your waiting period to 3 months which would make your premiums a whole lot cheaper. If you do have income protection, check what waiting period you have on your policy and then compare that with how much you have in your emergency fund. If you don’t have a lot in there, go back to the first quick win and aim to build up your emergency fund. If you have at least 3 months of expenses there, look into whether it’s appropriate for you and your needs to push out that waiting period and that will make your monthly premium considerably cheaper.Quick Win #2.5: Money Left on the Table?Another thing connected to income protection that a lot of people don’t know; a lot of income protection policies allow you to claim back the tax paid on the premiums. So, if you have an income protection benefit and you’ve never claimed back the tax on the premiums with your income tax return, reach out to somebody who is able to tell you whether you’re eligible and you might be able to backdate a whole lot of years' worth of premiums that you’ve paid and have a nice wee refund sitting there for you.Quick Win #3: Make Banking EasySet up goal accounts. When you get paid, figure out how much you’re going to put into your goal accounts, whether that be travel, saving for a home, children’s education, electric car, or whatever it may be. Put aside that money every week, fortnight or month and do it in separate accounts. Structure your accounts separately so when you go to spend out of those goal accounts, you don’t feel guilty about it. Instead of just having a big savings pot, you’ve got specific accounts for specific goals, and you can clearly see the progress of reaching your goal!If you are like most people and struggle with overspending, you can even go one step further and set up these goal accounts with a different bank. Set up a separate bank account with no debit card or phone access and accumulate your money without the temptation to spend! If the only way to get money out is by visiting the bank branch, you can save towards your goals faster and more effectively.",,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 00:53:45 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
A Better Investment than Property?,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579609212893-0MVF1CFQKX1UMXZ0T4TL/A%2BBetter%2BInvestment%2BThan%2BProperty.jpg?format=original,"Kiwi’s love property investment, that’s no secret. Last year over 313,000 Kiwi’s filed tax returns that declared rental income from property investment across residential, commercial and rural properties.For the younger generation in New Zealand however, owning a property to live in, yet alone one for the purpose of investment is a dream that is becoming increasingly more difficult.At FoxPlan we believe stockmarket investment is the solution for those looking to grow their wealth where property is unobtainable. Most of us are already stockmarket investors through our KiwiSaver but are spooked by the complexities of investing from our own paycheck.The ReturnsTake $10,000 in 1971. If this amount had been invested in NZ property, at the end of 2017 it would have been worth approximately $570,000 – a 9% average return.If we took this same amount of cash and invested it in global shares however at the end of 2017, our $10,000 would be worth $1.35m – a 11% average return.Even despite the Global Financial Crisis, multiple oil crises, the Silicon Valley tech boom and September 11, sharemarket investment has managed to outperform property in New Zealand by almost 200% over this 46 year period.Risky Investing?All investment involves risk. At FoxPlan we don’t believe in trying to pick stocks or outperform the market, but rather we take a long-term view of investment and market performance. We also recommend investment solutions based on your specific circumstances to take an acceptable level of risk in to account.As for speculative investment, we make it clear that this should not constitute more than 5% of your total portfolio and what you invest this way – you must be prepared to potentially lose entirely.It’s SimpleWe can set you up with an investment account through our fund managers. Once we have recommended and set up an appropriate investment solution you can then transfer funds from as little as $50 per month.And unlike property, you don’t need to save a deposit to get started.If you would like to get your own investment strategy in place, email Warwick Walker to have a chat today.

"A monthly voice from the past, considering the future",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1582447070803-4639LTA9YL3OHR2V815V/A+monthly+voice+from+the+past%2C+considering+the+future.jpg?format=original,"A couple of years ago I wrote a weekly blog in my role as the CEO of FoxPlan. I realised my readership was limited to graduate applicants looking to enhance their prospect for employment by feeding me back the most recent iteration plus a select few interested parties. So, I stopped writing, and no one complained!With 12 months to go until I depart from FoxPlan the current MD has suggested both clients and staff might enjoy reading an old hands perspective of current events as they pertain to various aspects of our transitioning profession – with relevance to client outcomes.A monthly voice from the past, considering the future.Richard Meadows wrote an excellent article on the late Jack Bogle in The Sunday Star Times on the 27th of January. Investors and advisers new to investment should read that article. Jack Bogle was the founder of the Vanguard Group – the second biggest investment firm in the world. It wasn’t always so because its beginnings came up against tradition, bias, competition and the Wall St establishment. Fundamentally Jack Bogle’s philosophy was founded on low fees and the minimising of human interference (fund manager active management) a passive approach to investing, Richard Meadows – I quote, “The passive investing revolution is only just starting to hit its stride in New Zealand. We can’t get those rock bottom 0.05% fees yet, but the middlemen selling Vanguard Funds - Simplicity, Superlife, Smartshares – can get us in the realm. It’s a huge improvement”.I don’t disagree in principle to the Richard Meadows assertions. I certainly support the Vanguard philosophy of passive investment and reduced fees. In my experience however, there are a couple of fundamental considerations which he doesn’t highlight, and they are critical (by way of transparency – FoxPlan uses Vanguard funds in both KiwiSaver (Booster) and Investment portfolios (Consilium).Firstly – ‘The Pendulum of investor Psychology’ or ‘The Cycle in Attitudes Towards Risk’. In short, human beings are wired to react to both positive and negative cycles. The economic cycle, the government involvement with the economic cycle, the profit cycle, the credit cycle, the distressed debt cycle, the real estate cycle – in total ‘The Market Cycle’. In my experience the biggest influence on investment outcome is investor behaviour; not fees or fund manager. Plain old fear or euphoria, as markets do their normal thing – but to the average investor market gyrations are far from ‘normal’. An adviser’s role is critical to ‘peace of mind’ when the media is screaming Armageddon and fund balances look to be in free fall. An adviser’s role is just as critical when investments are shooting the lights out and people are prone to rushing onto the bandwagon (finance companies, tech stocks, crypto currency, real estate).But don’t trust my bias as a financial adviser who wants to be paid for giving good, professional balanced advice and has done so for 44 years. Check the facts – the best source – Dalbar and Lipper. You will find a mismatch between market returns and investor returns – and unfortunately DIY investors, especially investors using index funds such as ETF’s. The options that Vanguard provides are the most negatively affected when the ‘markets’ create nervous nellies out of raging bulls. And when the opposite occurs, I refer to the hypnotism of booming markets as the investor’s equivalent to nitrogen narcosis – the euphoria of the deep – it kills divers and certainly did so financially to many finance company direct investors just prior to the Global Financial Crisis. Those investors who remained invested in well diversified funds over the last 10 years following the global financial crisis have been well rewarded for their patience and trust – in most likelihood because someone held their hand through the most tumultuous time in market history since the Great Depression.Second critical fundamental - ‘Asset Allocation’Market performance is volatile – history is our only true measure, however ‘probability under uncertainty’ is a reasoned and rational consideration. Risk and return are related, and growth assets have outperformed fixed income assets over all decades of time. Shares in companies and commercial property are ‘growth’ assets – bonds and money market cash funds are ‘defensive’ assets. Equities (shares in companies) have exceeded inflation by 7% over all recorded history – in every decade (including the 1930’s).I referred to the pendulum of investment and its psychological impact on investors – as with the pendulum of a large Grandfather Clock – the pendulum is seldom at the median. It is swinging from ‘underperformance’ to ‘outperformance’. But we know if the pendulum keeps swinging – the clock will tell us the correct time. The same for asset classes. Over time their performance and that of inflation is measured, consistent and ultimately reverts to mean.But just as the temperature and weather in Singapore is likely to experience less highs and lows than Christchurch, the median can be the same.Asset class returns (US based*) – Historical average*All democratic countries have a similar pattern, but I quote US for two reasons. It makes up nearly 50% of the worlds capital markets and it has records dating back to pre ‘Great Depression’.Equities 12% (Small Cap)Equities 10% (Large Cap)Fixed Income 6% (Bonds)Cash 4%Inflation 3%Investors need a plan to achieve investment outcomes and a portfolio most likely to achieve same. Both these functions are a product of advice. A robot will not hold your hand through the next crisis.Jack Bogle and Vanguard gave us the product, but advisers trained in the art and science of investment and financial planning are important members of the team for clients to maximise destination achievement and give peace of mind through the journey. Fees are important and a measured consideration but nothing in comparison to the 6% gap between average market performance and average market investor performance.At FoxPlan our aim is to achieve market performance for our clients and to design investment portfolios which under a lifetime of uncertainty and market cycles are most likely to achieve planned outcomes.Next Month: insurance reform and the political bandwagon John Killick The views and opinions expressed in this newsletter are not intended to be a personalised service for an individual retail client.

April 2022 - Quarterly Investment Update,,"We are pleased to enclose our Autumn Update covering the period from January to March 2022. Over the last two years, the world has been united in its fight against a common enemy, Covid-19. Unfortunately, a new threat has emerged in the first quarter of 2022, with Russia invading Ukraine in February. The world’s post-Covid recovery went off track as supply chain disruptions intensified, commodity prices spiked and global inflation pressures intensified.In the accompanying update, we reflect on some of the factors that influenced markets and investment returns over the recent quarter. Whilst market returns were adversely affected by the Russian invasion, history still provides plenty of evidence that the best strategy we can employ as investors is to stay calm. In the feature article by Consilium, we take a closer look at escalating inflation, why it is nicknamed the ‘silent thief’ and why most diversified investors are already well prepared for it.It continues to be an extraordinary time in the world, but what we do know is that careful diversification and a sound long term investment strategy have always passed with flying colours.As the year unfolds, we look forward to continuing to update you with the progress of investment markets and related investment insights.",,"Sun, 24 Jul 2022 23:48:08 +0000",GuestUser

Autumn Quarterly Update We are pleased to enclose our Autumn update covering the period from January 2024 – March 2024At the start of 2024, diversified investors saw continued gains in international share markets. Market sentiment was influenced by changes in inflation and interest rate expectations. Initially, there was anticipation of central banks lowering interest rates, but this was scaled back due to persistent inflation concerns, particularly in the US. Central banks like the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the US Federal Reserve proceeded cautiously, avoiding premature declarations of victory over inflation. The Bank of Japan, however, increased interest rates for the first time in 17 years.The global economy showed signs of improvement, with the US economy performing well, driven by consumer spending. The eurozone also saw progress, especially in manufacturing. Government bond yields adjusted as market sentiment shifted, leading to reduced returns from sovereign bond markets.The Japanese share market experienced significant growth, with the Nikkei 225 index reaching a 34-year high. This growth was attributed to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's economic policies, corporate governance reforms, a weak Japanese yen, and improved corporate profitability.Gold prices surged to an all-time high, reflecting investor interest in the metal as a store of value and diversifier. However, historical data shows that gold's long-term performance has varied, with periods of significant returns but also periods of lower returns, especially when adjusted for inflation. In New Zealand, the economy faced challenges, including mixed corporate earnings reports, a slowdown in the housing market, and rising mortgage rates. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand maintained a cautious stance on interest rates, aiming to balance inflation concerns with supporting economic growth.Despite short-term uncertainties, the document emphasizes the long-term positive outlook for investors, highlighting historical trends of economic growth, business expansion, increased profitability, and positive investment returns over time.Within the Autumn update, the Market Commentary section highlights the positive performance of international share markets in early 2024, influenced by factors such as inflation and interest rate expectations.The Key Movements Section outlines the performance of the asset classes in the first quarter of 2024. This quarter’s featured article by Consilium titled ‘The man who helped us understand the pain of losing’ honours Professor Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel laureate in behavioural psychology, for his insights into human decision-making, especially in investing. It introduces ""Loss Aversion,"" showing how people fear losses more than they value gains, leading to irrational investment behaviours like holding onto poor investments. Kahneman's work emphasises the importance of recognising and managing loss aversion to make better investment decisions and achieve financial goals.

For most New Zealander’s the last four or five weeks have been like no other. Never in our lifetimes have we all (except for a few essential businesses) been effectively ordered to go home and stay home. Of course, we all know why that was necessary. The COVID-19 health crisis we have been fighting is effectively a war that has simultaneously been waged all over the globe. And unfortunately, as in all wars, there have tragically been significant human casualties.Throughout the health crisis, international investment markets have remained open and, befitting this utterly extraordinary environment, the markets reacted in unprecedented fashion. The swift emergence of COVID-19 and the different containment measures that many countries employed in an attempt to contain its spread (ranging from social distancing, to travel bans, to self-isolation and lockdowns), created sudden and significant shockwaves for all markets. Reflecting the extreme nature of this event, the enclosed Autumn Update attempts to provide a detailed explanation about the market reaction to COVID-19. We hope you will find it interesting, if not useful.A quick word of warning - the enclosed newsletter is significantly longer than normal. Unfortunately, the unique and complex nature of what we have all just experienced couldn’t be easily condensed into just a few paragraphs.As we write this, we hope the worst of the health crisis is beginning to be behind us and that, here in New Zealand at least, we may soon be able to move towards a resumption of some greater ‘normality’.As the year unfolds, we will look forward to continuing to update you with the progress of investment markets in, we hope, much less turbulent times.Please read our detailed Economic Commentary by clicking on the link below.

Thoughts from the Chair #2  (Copy),,"Beginning with the end in mindWhen the country shut its doors through the covid pandemic, the social, economic, and financial framework which had characterised communities in New Zealand through my generation was transformed. How we are likely to progress through that transformation is the thinking behind this opinion piece.As a lifestage planner, the natural reaction is to consider ‘destination’. “To begin with the end in mind” as Stephen Covey would say. That’s what lifestage planning is all about. Getting clarity of where you want to go and then designing how to get there, through your lifetime. The interesting aspect of that however is the necessity to consider all parties. Insight into the ‘whole’ family, business, or group. Planning doesn’t work for multiple people if it's self-centred – that’s why politics becomes so difficult for governments to enact. Relationships don’t work when they are selfishly determined or when partisanship divides direction. Communication, collaboration, compromise. Not easy, but essential. When the couple or the family become prejudiced to personal desires the motivations are conflicted, the destination becomes blurred, the journey stressful, and lives are disrupted. That’s our position as a country.It must have felt similar following both world wars. Our parents and grandparents were shaped by those traumatic times. As a youngster through the fifties, I was conscious that conformity was values based predominantly on religion. The reforms from the ‘Depression’ came from politicians and were instigated by the newish ‘Labour Party’- and as a direct result began social reform – created by a need to respond to a disrupted environment. The ‘Church’ remained influential however just as occurred in America through Roosevelt, the ‘Progressive’ liberal movement in politics – driven primarily via academics, there commenced a change in fundamental policy and social reform. The primary industry and conservative values of ‘agricultural’ NZ changed, as urban expansion and ‘new age’ thinking slowly replaced the previous conformity. And the expansion of government in NZ grew exponentially – and it hasn’t stopped.For this generation, however, without the ‘benefit’ of parents and grandparents pre-baby boom – and without the fallback position (not all) of conservative values imprinted through family and Church – the environment has become a giant washing machine. The current health, behaviour, and productivity of the nation reflect the outcome. One of the positive results coming from that reaction is creating further disruption. Individuals and families have decided that being ‘at home’ – with the kids is pretty cool. If it can be managed via an obliging employer. The result: businesses, social services, and corporates are short-staffed – they need workers. The country lurches from shut down to a labour shortage to a massive immigration programme. (Record levels, never seen before). A net 50,000. That’s 100,00 New Zealanders departing to be replaced by 150,000 immigrants. Could be further disruptive? You bet – consider building a city the size of Rotorua – in 12 months. Now our infrastructure is bursting at the seams. Accommodation, roads, hospitals, schools – the pressure is building.If we accept that the NZ ruling structure is politically founded, then we should rebuild to a set of fundamental guidelines which enable the country to develop on a foundation of principles and values. (In lifestage planning we would call that – understanding the beliefs and values our clients wish to live their life by) From New Zealand’s perspective, we have a Bill of Rights – it needs tweaking but fundamentally it protects the civil and political rights of all NZs.Tyrannical regimes whether political or military (or a combination) do not have a constitution or Bill of Rights which provide the basis for a civil society. Those countries are never flooded with people wishing to live there, to build a purposeful life or to seek security for their family. Do politicians like to be constrained via a constitution or Bill of Rights? Doubt it – hence the composition of the same becomes outdated and often condemned as regressive and old-fashioned. As far as New Zealand is concerned, the Attorney General (who is also the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Oceans and Fisheries, and the Minister of Revenue) is very much a political appointment – hardly independent. Responsible for pre-legislative scrutiny of potential Bill of Rights breaches. Directors of all companies in NZ must comply with various Acts and regulations – it is incumbent upon them to govern with ‘Best Practice’ as a foundation – purpose, performance, accountability, and compliance. To do so they will follow the principles of a ‘Charter’, ‘Constitution’ and often a separate shareholders agreement which sets out expected behaviours and outcomes. Transparency and accountability.There are 100,000 NZs who have left and 150,000 immigrants who have arrived – in the last 12 months. The numbers tell a story. It could be of course that NZ has become a staging post for those wanting to get into Australia. (Another interesting fact is that NZ is rated as the second worst country to come to from questionnaires obtained internationally of all immigrants entering all new countries – the worst is Kuwait.) Whatever the reason for people to leave or others to arrive, there’s a few of us left who would like to stay. Just as the current Bill of Rights gives us the freedom to depart whenever we choose, I would like to think it should also determine a more productive and opportunistic capability for those of us wanting to stay – to live, to love, and to leave a legacy.",,"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 20:33:36 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
Are you better than a cat at investing?,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/37690365-f162-4200-9639-c2657fc3d2c6/1695345606144.png?format=original,"A strange question we know, but something all inspiring investors should ask themselves.During our first podcast, Tim shared an entertaining tale of Orlando the cat, who was challenged to beat a team of professional money managers at picking stocks. With the emergence of DIY investment apps at our fingertips, more and more Kiwis are having a go at stock picking. Now this is by no means an attack on having a go by yourself, we are actually very positive about people trying to learn more and give investing a go. However, we believe that if you’re going to invest by yourself, only invest what you can afford to lose, and understand what other options are out there.But what does this have to do with a cat?Back in 2012, a British paper called The Observer ran a contest challenging three parties to make the most money on the share market in a year with a beginning balance of £5,000. The competitors included a team of three professional money managers, a group of high school students, and a rather unconventional participant - a cat named Orlando.So, how did they do? When the dust settled and the results were in, Orlando the cat emerged victorious. The professionals applied their extensive knowledge to exploit market opportunities, while Orlando, in a playful twist of fate, simply tossed his toy mouse onto a grid of numbers representing different companies.At the end of the year, the professionals had increased their portfolio value to £5,176, the students were down to £4,840, and Orlando had amassed £5,542. Now we won’t fall down a rabbit hole discussing the “random walk hypothesis” but perhaps this theory that share prices move completely at random, and stock markets are entirely unpredictable may hold some weight.Of course, this study only tracked one year of results - but it begs the question, if professional managers struggled to beat a cat during the year, what makes individuals with their own full-time jobs, families, and hobbies think they can do it effectively by themselves?Interested in listening to our weekly podcast on financial literacy?

Are you on track with your KiwiSaver?,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/af9bd547-33df-4412-9aa8-92dab66fe01b/Did+you+know.....png?format=original,"Everyone loves a little helping hand and retirement savings can always do with a little boost! Did you know that any eligible person contributing to their kiwi saver account is eligible for the Government contributions so for every dollar you put into KiwiSaver the government will put in 50 cents - up to $521.4. How great is that?To get that full amount, you just need to contribute at least $1,042.86 by June 30th every year. If you’re an employee and are working full time, you’ll probably hit your minimum contribution without noticing. However, it’s always good to check your contributions for the year to make sure – why not log in now and see how much is in there? If you’re self-employed, you might not be contributing to your KiwiSaver automatically or receiving an employer contribution. Instead, you’ll need to make voluntary contributions. If you’re contributing roughly around $20 a week, you should hit the $1,042.86 goal each year. If you’re not going to hit the $1,042.86 for the year, you can bump up your contributions if you want to get there buy making a lump sum contribution before 30th June 2022. If this is the first time you are hearing of this and you would like to plan for next year, you could look at increasing your KiwiSaver contribution rate, making a lump-sum contribution, or setting up regular contributions to help you reach that goal. If you have missed out on the government contributions this year DON’T FEAR, you might not get the full contribution from the government, but you will still get 50 cents for every dollar you’ve contributed. Aiming to contribute $1042.86 per year is still a good way to make sure your savings for the future keep growing.

How To Talk About Money With Your Kids,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/6375f32a-161c-448b-b879-32403b4318f1/KA_01+_1_.png?format=original,"Are you wondering when's the best time to talk about money with your kids and teens?...Right now!Below are some practical ways to educate your mini's about money:Start early - the earlier you start the money conversation with your kids, the better. Start with small, easy to understand money concepts like having a piggy bank and saving pocket money.Begin with financial basics - what a bank account is and how to set one up, how to start a savings target/goal and the difference between needs and wants when it comes to spending money.Show your child real life examples - consider showing your child a recent monthly bill and chat about how you prioritise those expenses. Create a mind map or brainstorm ways to lower the bill, like remembering to turn off the lights when you leave a room.Give your child a chance to earn and spend their own money - encourage your child to make some money of their own, whether that’s an after school job, or helping around the house. Have a chat with them about responsible spending and goal setting.Be transparent - kids often learn through absorbing information, so the more you share with them about financial decisions you’ve made & learnt from, the more they’ll learn and remember for themselves in the future. Learn together - while your child might think you know it all, financial literacy is a journey for everyone. Take time to learn new things for yourself to pass onto your children like the wise old owl you are. Feel like you need some extra advice on how to start the conversation?

Avoid the Prediction Addiction,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/ab0ac874-222a-4f4a-b00d-153958fb79dc/stockimg-1-HsTnjCVQ798.jpg?format=original,"In 1968, Paul Ehrlich also wrote a best-selling book called The Population Bomb. Drawing on his observations with other animal species, the premise of the book was simple. The world was already overpopulated and still growing exponentially. The earth didn’t have enough resources to feed humanity. The result was inevitable. There would be mass starvation leading to nuclear world war, resulting in even worse environmental damage and more starvation.Can Experts Predict the Future? They usually have impressive credentials to their name, and they surely must know more than we do. But while experts can often explain in detail about what has already happened, it’s an open question of how accurate they are at predicting what will happen in the future.Philip Tetlock, noted academic and author, has made a living out of testing the accuracy of forecasts. He conducted a study that included 82,361 expert forecasts. To make the analysis simpler he grouped the forecasts into three possible alternatives.Groupings were based on whether the forecast was for:1. The status quo remaining.2. More of something; or3. Less of something. So, how impressive were the experts at picking which of those three options the future had in store?Well, not very good as it turned out.Tetlock found that experts performed worse than they would have if they had simply assigned an equal probability to all three outcomes.If this is true of general social sciences, how much better do you think experts will be at predicting the share market?Not very much.If you think about it, the price of a certain stock, or share is already a prediction of the future profits of a company. What’s knowable is in the price. To predict shares beyond a general trend is the equivalent of trying to predict a prediction. That doesn’t sound like an easy task and it’s not. Predicting the stock market is very difficult as no one can predict occurrences in the every-day economy.Fortunately, good investment outcomes don’t depend on guru predictions. They depend on having a plan, adjusting the plan as required to stay on track, and staying disciplined.Our investment providers follow an evidence-based approach to strategic asset allocation. We then monitor your investments relative to your needs, recommending prudent adjustments along the way when your circumstances, goals, or priorities change. That’s our job and it’s one we love to do. So, you can relax and enjoy your life and your wealth, with the confidence that you are invested prudently. Socially Responsible InvestingSocially responsible investing (SRI) has become an important consideration for many New Zealand investors as they become more aware and considerate of where their hard-earned savings are being invested.SRI can be implemented on a spectrum ranging from very soft changes to more stringent approaches. ESG IntegrationThis is the first step along the responsible investing spectrum. ESG integration is the consideration of environmental, social and governance factors when making investment decisions.Negative screeningWhen SRI funds are selecting which companies to invest into, the most common approach is to utilize a ‘negative screening’ process. This specifically seeks to exclude certain companies or industries assessed as having a negative impact on the environment (e.g. high carbon emissions) or on society (e.g. selling tobacco).Positive screeningSome SRI funds allocate to firms deemed ‘best-in-class’. For example, an electricity provider using predominantly hydro power will get a higher allocation than ones with a mix of hydro and perhaps coal burners. This is known as a ‘positive screening’ process.Thematic investmentsRather than starting with the broad market and excluding companies, thematic investing instead selects only companies with a common theme. This could be environmental themes such as clean energy, or forestry, or social themes such as healthcare innovation, aging population or supporting companies with the best inclusion and diversity records.Impact investingThis strategy invests into projects that promote a positive social or environmental impact, often ahead of the pursuit of financial gains. The investment is often used to fund specific projects via securities such as green bonds (e.g., Auckland council raised $200m specifically earmarked to help fund Auckland’s electric trains and associated infrastructure).Due to the degree of subjectivity surrounding the merits of different SRI strategies, not all investment funds attempt to satisfy the highest possible SRI objectives of all potential investors. Instead, they seek funds that place an emphasis on supporting higher levels of social and environmental responsibility, whilst remaining faithful to the prized investment attributes at the core of our investment philosophy — favouring low cost, widely diversified and non-speculative investments.That approach is to build robust portfolios that accommodate as many responsible investing preferences as possible, without compromising philosophy.

Blocking out investment noise,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/98d695ab-bc51-40bd-81ea-7af6dde067e5/1700174496710.png?format=original,"Treat forecasts and forecasters with scepticism, would be our big take from our seventh episode of the podcast. Wherever you get your news from, whether it's social media, the web, or TV, you've probably seen forecasters and journalists making commentary on where they think the market is going and why. Why do they do this? Simply put, headlines that incite fear or panic generate clicks, and clicks generate ad revenue for the media company. Most financial advisers worth talking to will tell you that they don't have a crystal ball that can predict where markets are going, but economists and the media love making bold predictions. So how well do they do? Here are a few examples of headlines and the following 12 months in the NZ share market. 2012 Otago Daily Times - ""Middling year expected"" - NZ Shares rose 24%2013 Dominion Post - ""Economic headwinds lurking"" - NZ Shares rose 16%2014 NZ Herald - "" We're probably fully valued"" - NZ Shares rose 18%2015 NZ Herald - ""Bull run near end of tether"" - NZ Shares rose 14%2016 NBR - ""End of the golden run"" - NZ Shares rose 9%2017 Noted - ""The easy gains for share investors appear to be over"" - NZ Shares rose 22%2018 NZ Herald - ""The potential is for lower equity returns than last year"" - NZ Shares rose 5%2019 NZ Herald - ""It's difficult to see what might turn the negative sentiment"" - NZ Shares rose 30%2020 NZ Herald - ""Eerie parallels to the 1920s"" - NZ Shares rose 14%2021 NZ Herald - ""2021 is shaping up for a year of recovery and rebound - NZ Shares fell 0.4%2022 NZ Herald - ""The NZ market is relatively well-placed heading into 2022"" - NZ shares fell 12%Looking at these atrocious track records, we would argue these journalists have no idea what they're talking about. Yet many investors see these articles and make investment decisions emotionally in response. It's human nature to want to react to information like this, but we'd encourage anyone who is investing for the long term, to very simply, block out the noise.",,"Tue, 05 Dec 2023 00:23:00 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
Building Resilience,,"COVID-19 has taught us that life doesn’t always go to plan. Certain situations or life events can change our plan at any time.

It’s vital that we keep our “must haves” alive even in time of desperation but it’s the “like to haves” that are flexible.

Buying Insurance Direct vs. with a Financial Adviser,,"In recent times, New Zealand's insurance industry has experienced a significant surge in 'direct distribution'. This involves insurance companies selling their products via digital channels such as banks, or via online comparison tools. With the growth of this direct approach, the question of whether it is more advantageous than obtaining personalised advice from an independent advisor is something many people have been considering.Let's take a closer look at why purchasing insurance direct may not be the right choice and why getting independent financial advice is a great option!Misconception #1: Buying direct is faster and more convenient.Insurance companies who market their products directly often promote the convenience, ease, and rapidity of their online application form. However, a shorter form means that there are fewer questions posed regarding one's health - this makes the process quicker, but it could possibly lead to mistakes which could cause issues when filing a claim.Remembering the symptoms and conditions you experienced years ago is essential when making a claim. To help you do that, the more detailed the application questions are, the better. On the flip side, if you answer too many generalised questions, you could miss out on essential information and potentially put your claim in jeopardy due to material non-disclosure, leading to an unpaid claim.We think having an adviser on board is essential when you first apply for any cover. Your adviser will walk you through the application forms, explaining the importance of the questions asked, and why they are important and emphasising the need to be transparent. Although this might be a lengthy process, it also provides the opportunity to customize your coverage and make sure your policy is suitable for your specific circumstances, giving you complete confidence in your coverage.Misconception #2: Insurance companies are all the same anyway so it doesn’t matter who I buy from It's no secret that not all insurance companies are made equal. While direct products may not offer the same coverage as those that advisors recommend, there's an even more critical difference between companies – how they handle claims!When it's time to make a claim, the discrepancies in claims management become apparent; all too often, people come to realize that not all insurance companies provide the protection they need. Just look at the abundance of press coverage concerning disputes around claims - some insurers will do anything to avoid having to pay out. Without an independent financial adviser who possesses the specialist expertise and experience of the sector, you can find yourself vulnerable to the company who you once trusted to be there for you.Misconception #3: An adviser wont be there when I need them anyway! The importance of a financial adviser's advocacy role is often overlooked. But life has a way of throwing curveballs at us, and when it does, the last thing anyone needs is the anxiety of managing a claim. Having an adviser by your side when that day arrives, however, can take the load off your shoulders, simplifying the process and ensuring that the product provider is fair. This way, you can remain focused on what really matters; you and your family.Having a trustworthy, reliable advisor can be a priceless asset! They will assess and make sure that you and your family have the necessary level of protection, keeping an eye on any changes in your circumstances. But, above all, they will be your ally during the claims process.If you want to ensure your insurance covers all your needs, whenever you need it, having a great independent adviser in your corner is the way to go! So why not seek out our advice? It'll be the best decision you make.",,"Sun, 26 Mar 2023 21:31:55 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
Buying your first home with only 5% deposit,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579457392152-ILN478M5YGCNZAYJLYRG/Buying+a+house+with+5+deposit.jpg?format=original,"The Wellington Region has seen significant growth in house prices over the last five years. Whilst this growth has been great news for those already on the property ladder, the first home dream has started to feel increasingly distant for young buyers.This week we look at the changes announced by the government that aim to give confidence back to these buyers.Why the changesThe major issue for first home buyers in Wellington has been trying to get in the sweet 20% deposit space where banks love to lend. Buying with this level of equity means better loan rates as well as a few bonuses on the side such as cash contributions. In 2016, an average 20% deposit for a 3/4 bedroom home in the region was $98,430, today it’s $134,610.Whilst house prices have grown significantly in this period, the cost of servicing a mortgage has not. With record low interest rates being offered for significant fixed periods, both banks and the government are aware that many buyers have the capacity to service a home loan but are being locked out due to being unable to get a 20% deposit. That’s where the 5% deposit changes come in to play.How can I access 5% lending?The changes announced by the government relate to the First Home Loan (previously Welcome Home Loan). To access the FHL there are a few important criteria:Firstly there is an income cap applicable - $85,000 before tax for one person or $130,000 combined for two.Secondly, the FHL is only available for properties with a value up to $550,000 in the Wellington region.The third criteria is that it must be the first home for all of those purchasing the property.If you fit in this criteria, 5% lending should be open to you – allowing you to purchase a $550,000 property with only $27,500 in the bank. You could also potentially access up to $5,000 as an individual or $10,000 as a couple from the First Home Grant reducing this amount even further.What if $550,000 isn’t enough?The good news is many New Zealand banks are working through offering lending options as low as 5% deposit to both properties and buyers that do not qualify for the FHL. We expect by the end of the year many of these offerings to be available to the market.In addition, there are several non-bank lenders (such as building societies and credit unions) who have lent and continue to lend to this market, many people are simply unaware as they tend to lack the large marketing budgets of the major banks!We can sort out your first homeOur team at FoxPlan Mortgages are all across the 5% deposit changes and more than happy to have a chat with you about getting your (or your kids) first home sorted.

Jamie along with Kevin Biggar featured on TV in the acclaimed series First Crossings. What many may not know, is that along with Kevin, he has also rowed across the Atlantic in record breaking time, and they walked unaided 1200km to the South Pole. Below, republished with Jamie’s permission, is his view of people’s responses to Covid-19. It's day two of the lockdown here in New Zealand.Day two of Kevin and my rowing race across the Atlantic Ocean offered five lessons I believe are relevant for us all, that I've mentioned below. I've also included tips on managing conflict with your partner, and a toilet paper alternative!Let's go...As we set out on an adventure I had dreamed about, racing 5000km across the Atlantic Ocean in a tiny rowing boat, everything was going to plan… On day two, my mate (Kevin Biggar) and I faced unexpected adversity. We found ourselves in the middle of a major storm. Headwinds, waves and currents – all trying to push us back to the start line in the Canary Islands. With our progress stalled we faced a choice. Put out a sea anchor, which would reduce the rate at which we would be pushed backwards, but at least we would conserve precious energy. Or, keep rowing. Sadly, the footage never captured how bad it really feltWe took the tough decision and kept rowing. We adapted our shift pattern and worked together. We had no idea what the other 16 crews in the race were doing. For 42 hours we rowed, and rowed, and rowed, but travelled less than half a mile across the ocean. Tired and disheartened, finally the storm passed over us, and we made the call to our support team by satellite phone. “Whatever you’ve been doing, keep doing it” they said. “Everyone else has gone backwards [they all put out their sea anchor], and you are now 30 miles in front!”Forty days later, we crossed the finish line in Barbados, winning in world record time. Our winning margin? Just over 30 miles! Might this story of adventure on the high seas offer some lessons during COVID-19 and the lockdowns we’re experiencing around the world? I think so. How we cope with times of adversity, deal with ambiguity, and encourage innovative thinking can create an ultimate and sustainable competitive edge. It isn’t just bloody-mindedness. Rather, success is the result of stretching ourselves, thinking the options through analytically, backing our judgment, adapting our processes, and believing in our ability. Here are five lessons from rowing through that storm with Kevin that I’m keeping in mind during COVID-19 and nationwide lockdowns. #1: The language we use changes how we think, then how we behaveWe’re not stuck at home. We’re safe at home. Big difference.We’re not being isolated from others. We’re protecting others (incl. essential workers and our country’s future). Big difference.People in our house are being annoying. We’re learning about ourselves and how we respond to challenges. Big difference.In psychology, one of the most common styles of dysfunctional thinking is ‘catastrophising’ — when you take whatever’s happening, imagine the worst case scenario, then worry yourself into a frenzy about it BEFORE it has happened.If you have a tendency to do this, give yourself a break: it’s super-common. But it’s also extremely unhelpful and can be a trigger or maintaining factor for depression and anxiety — and perhaps a desire to buy toilet paper! Keep in mind that even if you did run out, toilet paper hasn’t always existed, and there are alternatives. Ancient romans used a communal ‘gompf stick’ – a piece of sponge tied to the end of a stick to clean yourself! 🙂 #2: CHOOSE your response, rather than behave as though changes are happening TO YOU There are events in our lives we can’t change, but we can change our response to them that will fundamentally affect the outcome. Who would have thought ONE conversation Kevin and I had on day two of the race would decide the result (I reckon) six weeks later? Your reactions are contagious.COVID-19 may never come into your home but your responses to changes are already there, and anxiety is easily passed on. Think about the people around you, especially if you’re a parent. You don’t want to train your kids to be easily scared, led by their feelings, and have an every-person-for-themselves attitude. You’re allowed to have, and express, feelings but base your words on facts and truth. In the words of Gandhi, “Be the change you want to see in the world”, even if you have to pretend for a while. Structure your days — fall in love with a list.There can’t be many things more motivating than a sense of progress. On the ocean we had map with milestones to cross off. I’ll talk about this more next time, but before you go to bed, write a list of what you’re going to do the next day. And after you get dressed each morning, make your bed! It’s the easiest way to prove to yourself that you can complete a task.#3: Sometimes when you think you’re making the least progress, you’re actually making the mostWe started the race with incredibly high expectations of ourselves, with previous races setting the benchmark for peak performance. The storm on day two could have been the end of our campaign – and my hopes of becoming a career adventurer. It turned out, though, that the lesson from that storm informed how we’d behave when another storm hit us on day 32.Did the other crews find out we kept rowing after day two? Absolutely. Did those same crews put out their sea anchor again on day 32? You guessed it, yepIn New Zealand, perhaps the biggest sector to be affected from COVID-19 is tourism. Tourism Holdings CEO and Tourism Industry Association Deputy Chair Grant Webster describes the situation beautifully. “Here is an opportunity to rebirth the industry in a manner that is aligned with tikanga Māori, that is aligned with environmental sustainability. This is the biggest reset opportunity the industry has ever had, and will ever have.”#4: Our relationships last far longer than the storm Kevin and I are different in so many ways, but we knew our performance (boat speed) was directly linked to our individual and shared wellbeing (some might call it ‘engagement’). We committed to showing compassion, empathy and understanding from the outset. Doing this when you’re tired and frustrated isn’t easy, so we agreed some simple techniques to keep moral high. For example, if I was ever angry with Kevin I had to tell him, but only by speaking in a foreign accent! For the record, mine was German. Fun games like this mitigated the risk an ego-war on a tiny boat mid-ocean. At a conference recently a woman told me she and her husband had a technique for conflict too.“Whenever we have an argument at home, we have to start taking our own clothes off. Eventually it just gets weird and we agree an answer”. Kevin and I didn’t do that. Hopefully, the goodwill you spread now will last longer than the pandemic. And if you’re struggling yourself, reach out. You’ll be surprised how you’ll be helping others by doing so.#5: Be deliberate with your operating model in the stormAn operating model is ‘how’ an organisation works. For us on the boat, that meant things like: The shift pattern of rowing vs. rest;Communication with media;Navigation and technology;Monitoring our performance; and,What each of us were responsible for.During the storm, and once we decided we’d keep rowing, all these things needed to adjust. The point is, we were deliberate with what our target operating model needed to be. Here’s what I’d consider to be the elements of an operating model for an organisation. Make sure your enterprise has clarity and alignment for each element. So, here’s Jamie's final message.Tell yourself that your responses to COVID-19 and lockdowns are your decision. Will you put out the sea anchor, or keep rowing? The views and opinions expressed in this article are not intended to be a personalised service for an individual retail client.

"Compound Interest, the eighth wonder of the world",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/125ac49d-920b-43cf-954b-db9fba205af7/1699478272064.png?format=original,"On this episode of the podcast, we talked about all things compounding. Albert Einstein once famously said ""Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it.""The magic of compounding is that it starts off very slowly, but we liken it to a snowball rolling down a hill, it starts to gather speed and becomes bigger and bigger. Tim gave a great example of the power of compounding by sharing the centuries-old story about the con artist who scammed the king. Naturally, there are plenty of different versions of the story, but the gist of it is that the King and a chess player had a game, and if the chess player won, he would get any reward he asked for. After the chess player won the match, the reward he asked for was simple - one grain of rice on the first square of the chessboard, two on the second, four on the third, and so on, doubling the amount of the previous square for the entire board. The King, thinking he's got a great deal, agreed immediately and instructed his treasurer to pay out the winner with his prize. You can probably see where this is going. The rice was put on the squares, doubling every time, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so it went. By the end of the fourth row, the King needed 2.1 billion grains of rice and it was probably at this point that the King realised he'd been conned and wouldn't be able to uphold his side of the bargain. What was the total amount at the end of the board? 18,446,744,073,709,600,000. Try saying that number out loud, good luck!The same principles work in your favour with investments. Now obviously you can't expect your investments to double every year, but the snowball effect really does play a part in the process. Arguably the greatest investor of all time, Warren Buffet, when asked about his success, said “My wealth has come from a combination of living in America, some lucky genes, and compound interest.”Compounding works best when you give it lots of time, which is why the earlier you start the better.",,"Wed, 01 Nov 2023 00:21:00 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
Coronavirus COVID-19 New Zealand government rescue package,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1585164125842-1V046N1ZH82TMGROAW2T/Blake+Chamberlain?format=original,"Dear Valued Clients,With Finance Minister Grant Robertson warning that coronavirus COVID-19's economic consequences may exceed those of the last global financial crisis, the New Zealand government has announced a NZD12.1 billion package to cushion the pandemic's economic impact.This email focusses on the new wage subsidy, leave payment and tax implications of the package that is aimed towards supporting business owners:Wage subsidyBusinesses that can show they have had a 30% decline in revenue for any month between January and June 2020 compared to the year before can claim wage subsidies. Applications can also be made on the basis of forecast revenue loss within that period.Employers who claim the subsidy will be paid NZD585.50 per week for full-time staff and NZD350 per week for part-time staff. The pay-out will be a one-off lump sum, covering a period of 12 weeks. This means NZD7,029.60 for a full-time employee and NZD4,200 for a part time employee. The maximum amount any one employer can receive is NZD150,000.Business owners should be aware that in order to be able to receive this assistance they will need to undertake:-To continue, to the best of their endeavours, employing the affected employees at a minimum of 80% of their income for the duration of the 12-week subsidy period; and - To take active steps to mitigate the impact of coronavirus COVID-19, and sign a declaration to that effect, such as engaging with their bank and financial advisor.Affected employers can make applications to the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) from 17 March 2020 until 9 June 2020. Further details and application forms can be found here.These measures and the undertakings required of those businesses claiming the subsidy reflect the government's priorities of promoting business confidence and staff retention over the next few months.Leave paymentA new leave payment has been made available to support people and businesses where there is a need to self-isolate, or where a person cannot return to work due to their own coronavirus COVID-19 diagnosis or the diagnosis of a dependent.The leave payment will be paid out at a flat rate of NZD585.80 per week, for people working 20 or more hours per week, and NZD350 for those working less than 20 hours per week. It will be paid to employers who have eligible employees in self-isolation (as well as to eligible self-employed workers) and must be passed on to the employee in full. Employees are not required to have used paid leave entitlements before they can receive the leave payment. Where the person is self-isolating, the payment can be received for 14 days, with applications for further payments to be made on an ""as-needed"" basis where a person must self-isolate more than once.Where the payment is for someone unwell or looking after a dependent, then the payment can be received for the entire period of their illness, but the employer will need to reapply every 14 days.The leave payment will be available for eight weeks from 17 March 2020. Applications must be made to MSD. Further details and application forms can be found here.The government will also be providing immediate benefit increases, income support and an increase to the winter energy payment for beneficiaries and those on low incomes.TaxFour new tax measures have been announced to support businesses affected by coronavirus COVID-19:1. Depreciation on commercial and industrial buildings. Depreciation deductions are reintroduced for new and existing industrial and commercial buildings, including hotels and motels. This law change will allow owners of commercial and industrial buildings to start claiming depreciation deductions at a 2% rate on a diminishing value basis. Though the commencement date for this change is somewhat unclear, we understand this change is intended to apply for the 2020/21 income year.2. Immediate deductions for low value assets. Increasing the allowance for immediately deductible low-value assets in the year of purchase. The threshold for low-value immediately deductible assets will increase from NZD500 to NZD5,000 for the 2020/21 income year, and will be permanently increased to NZD1,000 for future income years. The Inland Revenue says that this should reduce tax compliance costs and encourage business to continue to invest.3. Fewer small businesses having to pay provisional tax. The Government has increased the threshold at which provisional tax is payable from NZD2,500 to NZD5,000. This will benefit some smaller taxpayers and, for example, delay the due date for tax payments for 2020/21 income year until the terminal tax due date to 7 February 2022.4. Writing off interest on late payments of tax for certain taxpayers. The Inland Revenue will be given the power to waive interest on late paid tax (including GST and PAYE) for those who have been significantly adversely affected by coronavirus COVID-19. A taxpayer will have to show an inability to pay tax by the due date as a result of being significantly adversely impacted by coronavirus COVID-19. Further details on the objective tests will be finalised in the coming days.It does not appear that the proposed tax changes will go as far, or have the immediate cash impact for most businesses, as was suggested by the finance minister in his speech. Further tax changes could have been made to support SMEs or businesses in a tax loss position.If you require any assistance with this please feel free to touch base with the team at FoxPlan Accounting & Wealth management.

COVID-19 and your money: 7 things to do right now - from Sorted,,"We’ve recently come across this blog post from Sorted and thought it was so good that we needed to re-share. You can find the original blog post here on Sorted’s website. We’re living in such a changed world that it can feel overwhelming. The coronavirus has upended our working lives, our kids’ lives, and our money lives as well. That said, there's a lot we can do: here are 7 things to do straight away.1. Avoid decisions based on fearWe’ll get through this together, so no need to panic. Emotional situations tend to lead to poor financial choices, so be sure to get the help you need as you make financial decisions during an emergency. Take the time to get information and advice on what you would like to do.2. Find out what financial help is availableThe government is acting to support the economy, including leave and self-isolation support, subsidised wages, and business cash flow and tax measures. Find out more on the official COVID-19 government response site or call the free government helpline on: 0800 779 997 (8am–1am, 7 days a week).3. Make a crisis money planEspecially during an emergency, creating a money plan is key. Financial stresses can cause considerable hardships for you and your family – so having a plan helps bring peace of mind.Work through a scenario for reduced income. In order to best manage your money, it's important to identify your incomings and outgoings.Focus on your immediate “needs”; cut back on any unnecessary “wants”.Give every single dollar a job to do. This means you decide what all of your money will be used for and prioritise what’s most important.Set aside any extra money you have – even just $5 or $10 – into a safety net.If things are too tight to manage, help is available. 4. Find out all your options before taking on more debtIf you don’t have an emergency fund, consider putting some money aside each time you’re paid if you can. Depending on how the situation evolves, you may need to rely on your safety net sooner than expected.If you feel you need to borrow to get by, it’s important not to run to the easiest money available. A short-term payday loan online or a KiwiSaver hardship withdrawal may first come to mind, but there may be other options are likely to be better: government support, temporary loan or mortgage holidays, or consolidating your debt to a lower interest rate with more manageable payments.The goal is to get through and create as little debt as possible.5. Can’t make repayments? Talk to your lender as early as possible to make arrangementsThe earlier you talk to your bank or lender, the better. You might be surprised how they’re willing to make things work with you and your loan. The sooner you get in touch, the better placed they are to help you deal with financial stress. After all, they deal with this sort of thing all the time. Depending on what you’re experiencing, your lender could:Temporarily suspend loan repayments. The government announced a 6-month holiday on mortgage repayments, although note that interest will continue to accrue for that time period.Move you to interest-only paymentsRestructure business loansConsolidate loans to make repayments more manageableProvide short-term funding6. Stay safe from COVID-19 scamsCrises tend to bring out the best in all of us, but unfortunately the worst can also be seen if you look carefully. Frauds and scams related to coronavirus are popping up like poisonous mushrooms, especially online, so make sure to verify every call, link and email that comes your way – it could easily be a fake. A good way to check is to make a separate call to a published number to make sure something’s the real deal.7. Ignore your KiwiSaver balanceIf you’ve been concerned about KiwiSaver’s ups and downs, feel free to not look for a while – just ride it out. This is true for most KiwiSaver members, unless you plan to use the money to retire or for a first home in the next 3 years – in which case, it might be good to shop around for a defensive fund. Here are some FAQs for KiwiSaver members.Sorted & TVNZSorted teamed up with TVNZ for a half-hour show that helps us all take a breath – and move forward with our money after the lockdown.

8 Retirement Statistics That Should Scare You Into Action,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1714687522435-3FOZS1SLG6TP1RL4KIM4/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"Retirement planning might not be the most thrilling topic, but let’s face it, it’s pretty important. It’s all about making sure you can kick back and enjoy life when the time comes. But having enough for retirement is far from sunshine and daisies… Here are 8 scary statistics that show us Kiwis might need to improve on our planning. 56% of New Zealanders are living payday to payday.Imagine waiting eagerly for your paycheck every week, fortnight or month, knowing that without it, you’d struggle to make ends meet. Well, that's the reality for more than half of Kiwis. 56% are stuck in a cycle where they spend everything they earn, leaving no room for unexpected expenses or emergencies.Over 48% of Kiwis say they couldn’t survive for two months with no income.Almost half of New Zealanders would find themselves in deep water if they lost their income for just two months. Think about it—no paycheck coming in for sixty days! It highlights how many of us are just one crisis away from financial trouble. Having a safety net for tough times is crucial, whether it's an emergency fund, savings, insurance, or other forms of support. NZ Super can be only $27,000 a year.Retirement—the golden years, right? Well, not always. The maximum a single person can get from NZ Super is around $27,000 a year (or about $41,600 for couples). While it helps, it might not stretch as far as you think, especially with rising costs. It’s a reminder that relying solely on NZ Super might not provide the cushy retirement we dream of. Saving extra for retirement is like adding sprinkles to your ice cream—it makes it sweeter.Only 65% of New Zealanders are investing.Believe it or not, only about two-thirds of Kiwis are taking the plunge into investing. That means a big chunk of us are missing out on potential ways to grow our money. Whether it’s stocks, property, business, or something else, investing can be a smart move for building wealth over time. Maybe it’s time for more of us to dip our toes into the investing pool! The average Kiwi expects to need just over $470,000 for retirement (incorrect).While $470,000 might seem like a hefty sum, it might not be enough to cover all your expenses in retirement, especially if you want to maintain your current lifestyle. Things like healthcare, travel, and leisure activities can add up quickly. So, it's wise to aim for a retirement fund that can support you comfortably for the long haul. It's like planning for a marathon—you want to have enough endurance to cross the finish line with ease.26% of Kiwis save nothing.Picture this: more than a quarter of Kiwis aren’t putting any money aside for the future. No emergency fund, no savings for a rainy day. Saving might not sound exciting, but it’s like planting seeds for your financial future. Half a million NZ consumers are in debt arrears.Did you know that a whopping half a million Kiwis are behind on their debt payments? That's a lot of people juggling bills and struggling to keep up with their financial commitments. Being in debt arrears can add stress and strain to everyday life, making it harder to break free from the cycle of debt. It's a sign that many of us could benefit from better budgeting and financial planning to stay on top of our finances.New Zealanders are over $6 billion in credit card debt.Yep, you read that right—Kiwis collectively owe over $6 billion in credit card debt. That's a staggering amount of money! Credit cards can be handy for managing expenses, but they can also lead to financial trouble if not used wisely. It's like a snowball rolling downhill—the debt can quickly pile up if you're not careful. This is a reminder to use credit responsibly and to pay off balances promptly to avoid getting buried under a mountain of debt.So, what can we take away from all this? Well, it's clear that we need to start paying more attention to our finances. Whether it's setting aside a bit of cash for emergencies, looking into smart ways to invest our money, or just being more careful with our spending, there's always something we can do to improve our financial situation. By taking small steps now, we can set ourselves up for a brighter, more secure future. After all, when it comes to money, a little bit of planning can go a long way!",,"Thu, 02 May 2024 22:11:20 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
Digital Money,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579469393770-D4B0XFSY20X06EMPEVSV/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"Facebook recently announced the launch of its own digital currency ‘Libra’. Facebook envisions this currency being used to pay for everything including your daily coffee, eCommerce and even financial services.Facebook are not alone in this space. There are currently over a thousand forms of digital/crypto currency available and this number is only likely to balloon as we progress in to the 21st century.This week we talk about the implications of digital money for Kiwis.Tracking your balanceA savings account balance of $10,000 is tangible and easy to understand. We don’t need to see the cash to understand its value and even if it’s only numbers on the screen of a mobile – for most of us it feels real.But add a balance of 4,500 Libras on top – things start to become less tangible.Now consider a world where TradeMe has its own currency. Additionally, your internet provider, power company, online streaming service and supermarket have grouped together around a separate currency altogether. Just how much money or wealth do you have and how do you even start to measure it?This future may sound farcical – but even 10 years ago the idea of paying for goods and services by just tapping your phone was not on the radar for most of us. Technology is continuing to change the way we transact and at a more rapid pace than ever before.One thing is clear – Kiwis are going to have to become more financially literate in this digital world to compete.The positivesDigital currencies have the potential to radically disrupt commerce in New Zealand. The ability to instantly settle funds with negligible transaction fees will allow businesses to reduce costs and collect their funds sooner – fueling expansion and innovation.For international trade, currency conversion and exchange fees are likely to disappear – expanding the global horizons of many Kiwi firms.It’s not just Silicon ValleyThe Indian Reserve Bank as well as many South Korean banks are actively exploring the use of digital currencies. There are still plenty of practical and legislative issues to be tackled around financial security, crime and technology when it comes to digital currency but the change is well underway.Our recommendation is to keep abreast of these changes. Digital currencies won’t arrive overnight but by being on the front foot, we can minimize the disruption that may occur in our lives when they do.

Dissatisfaction With KiwiSaver Is Rife,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579609308442-HURJCH91MWGC4BKJ1AK5/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"Consumer New Zealand have produced their latest KiwiSaver satisfaction ratings and it’s sobering reading for nearly all New Zealand KiwiSaver providers.On average, only 48% of Kiwis are satisfied with their KiwiSaver provider, down from 52% in 2018.What is driving dissatisfactionIt’s probably not surprising that market performance impacts consumer satisfaction. With recent volatility many Kiwi’s have seen drops of over 10% in their portfolio. This is however a trend across the market and few funds have escaped unscathed. With the NZX-50 having recently cracked the 10,000 mark, setting a new record and doubling in almost five years chances are some of this dissatisfaction will likely disappear as returns recover.But this isn’t just a story about returns. Driving dissatisfaction is the quality of information and process by which consumers learn about their funds with some rather worrying statistics:Almost 75% of Kiwis do not know the level of fees they pay in their KiwiSaver fundAlmost 66% do not know how their fund compared to the rest of the market44% are not confident KiwiSaver funds will be enough to support their retirement45% do not feel their provider helps them keep up to date with their investmentFoxPlan can provide clarityFees and PerformanceThe Financial Markets Authority (FMA) provide an Interactive KiwiSaver Tracker which can be accessed here. This tool allows comparison of funds on performance and provides a simple visual aid to see the proportion of return paid as fees.RetirementWe agree with the 44% of Kiwis that do not think their funds will be enough to support their retirement. KiwiSaver alone is not a strong enough retirement strategy and should instead act as a safeguard if your other retirement investments (whether they be savings, shares or property) fail to perform. If you do not have any of these other investments in place, we strongly recommend speaking to a financial adviser.Keeping up to dateA quarterly update from your provider is a minimum. At FoxPlan we recommend you go further and meet with your adviser as required to review your KiwiSaver.

Do You Have the Itch to Switch?,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/a5c7194f-c755-41e6-afd3-11c8ae429d50/corp+market.jpg?format=original,"Do you have the temptation to change your investment strategy? Do you have the itch to switch? During market volatility, many investors might be tempted to change their investment strategy, be it, where their money is invested or investment method, in order to temper fluctuations in the market.Investment planning works with an overarching view of your objectives and is aided by an appropriate strategy. This will answer the age old question ""should I switch?"". Part 1 - StrategyInvestment Strategy: Which of the following is most appropriate?1. Stock-picking2. Betting on alternative investments such as gold or cryptocurrency3. Owning small pieces of major companies in the world4. Keeping cash in the bankHaving a strategy is a pillar of your investment plan. It is a vehicle to have you moving to your intended destination.The question is, which strategy is best suited to achieve your goals?Owning specific stocks? Owning small pieces of every company? Or just to keep it at the bank?While it is quite tempting to own shares of renowned companies or alternative investments that keep on popping up on the news, be it for their great profits or popularity. Let’s give it some thought. While a company could be extremely successful, not all can sustain success. It may not necessarily be caused by poor management, but it could also be a result of the industry evolution, government regulations, and many other external factors. Given the multitude of variables, what happens if the company ceases to exist, or if the company’s value plummets? The same could be said of alternative investments.On the other side of the token, should investors then own small pieces of every major company around the world? The gist of owning a variety of shares in different companies is that collectively, the returns of the majority of the companies will offset the poor performance of other companies. As the investment is diversified, the return on the investment will be the average of all the companies invested in, thus reducing the risk of just owning one, or just a few companies.Or should you take a more apparent route, keeping your hard-earned cash in the bank? You have the convenience of simply visiting a bank branch, having your money withdrawn, or even viewing the funds coming in and coming out from your mobile phone or computer. However, will the small amount of interest be sufficient to tackle inflation of 5% or more?With the turbulence you have seen in the market, many investors would be wary and prefer for the storm to calm down, before making a move. However, you may want to ask yourself these few questions to make sense of your investment strategy. Part 2 – Questions to Ponder1. Are you clear about what your goals are?2. Do you have sufficient cash for your short-term needs, i.e., 3-5 years.?3. If you are not yet retired, are you investing enough?4. If you are already retired, do you feel you are spending too much, or worried, therefore cutting back, when in fact you could be spending more?These questions are to assist you in making robust financial decisions. If you are not clear on what your goals are, would a chat with your partner or adviser help? If you are clear, do you have clarity on the actions needed to be taken? If you would like to discuss your investments with your Adviser please get into contact with them for a review meeting. Questions from Our Clients: Judy, our investment client here at FoxPlan has asked, should she change the amount invested in shares to bonds, given the current volatility?We really appreciate your question, Judy.Historically, shares have been outperforming both cash and bonds in the long run. Over a 50-year run since the 31st of December 1970, New Zealand Equities have returned an average of 12.4%1, while New Zealand Bonds have returned 7.4%[1]. Over this period, inflation was 5.6% (Reserve Bank of New Zealand, 2022)To put into perspective, if $10,000 was invested in New Zealand Equities and another $10,000 in New Zealand Bonds over the 50-year period, the funds invested in New Zealand Equities will be worth $3,859,099.New Zealand Bonds? $376,543.But inflation would have eroded the purchasing power of your $10,000 to $561.While both Shares and Bonds surpass the rate of inflation, Shares over the long run do outperform the bonds.[1] Annualised (p.a.) compound pre-tax return, return from both capital growth and income.Adviser Commentary: During market volatility, it is easy to react to new information in the news. It is important that we take a step back and consider how we could potentially use this to your advantage to help achieve your short, medium, and long-term goals. With inflation at record highs, investing is a key component in retaining purchasing power and seeks to avoid your money going backwards We are only a phone call or an email away should you wish to discuss this in relation to your situation.

"Don’t change long term plans due to short term “noise""",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1586674296906-1650MIOAJBWBCOBP89B2/WW.png?format=original,"Dear clientsWe are sure you have been bombarded by all kinds of media focusing to the short-term effects on investment markets from people’s response to the Covid-19 virus.Here are a couple of examples of context.You are sitting in your nice, new, comfortable home which you purchased intending to live there indefinitely or at least for several decades.You hear a knock at the front door.Opening the door, you see someone looking rather stressed and bedraggled.“Yes?” you say cautiously. Your unexpected visitor announces, “I’m your neighbour. I just wanted you to know that I’m willing to buy your house today for 60% of what you just paid for it…”You quickly interject, “Uhhh… no thanks,” and you close the door… firmly.Unfortunately for you, day after day, that same neighbour shows up to tell you how much he’s willing to pay for your house. On most days you manage to ignore him. But he seems to shout the loudest when his price is either really high or really low compared to the price you paid.Most of us would call the police on such an annoying neighbour. However, we can’t call the police on the news outlets that constantly tell us what the market is willing to pay us for our portfolio. But it can be just as annoying.Similar to buying a house, most people purchase an investment portfolio to provide them with a lifetime of benefits. Despite that very long-time horizon, we are exposed, on almost a daily basis, to information about what the market is willing to pay us if we decided to sell out today. But here’s the rub, we’re not selling out our entire portfolio today, we’re not selling out tomorrow and, in fact, we’re not selling out for the rest of our lives if we can help it.Selling out now is counterintuitive anyway. When our noisy neighbour offers us a low price for our house, we ignore him. But when offered a low price for an investment portfolio, people can surprisingly react quite differently. The reason they might act differently is usually a combination of fear and uncertainty. But the ironic part is that many investors feel compelled to sell out just because someone is willing to pay them less than they paid for the same portfolio. History tells us that diversified portfolios have always recovered, every single time, so why sell?.You might say, but I’ve lost money and I need to sell while I still can. But the reality is, you only “lose” when you do sell and crystalise the loss. Until then, it’s just another crazy price proposal being put forward by your noisy neighbour, Mr Market.Here is a short video we have put together to illustrate the noise and the benefits of a long-term view.

Explaining Financial Planning,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579608163962-29NM7V6IW5O3P85B1OAQ/Explaining%2BFinancial%2BPlanning.jpg?format=original,"Ask five different people ‘what is financial planning?’ and you’ll likely get five completely different answers. It’s this very confusion that often puts people off the idea of financial planning altogether – so this week we thought we would break down the FoxPlan model of financial planning to the very basics.GoalsBefore we even sit down and look at your data, we have a conversation with you to understand what your short, medium and long-term goals are. This creates a clear understanding of what your financial plan needs to achieve.Spend Vs. SaveWith your goals understood, we need to create the foundation to get you there. This starts by understanding your spending habits. If you spend more than you earn, there is no way of reaching your goals.Bank AccountsWe then create a budget with you so that there is a surplus. We do this by taking three months of your spending data so we can give you a 360-degree view of your finances. We use the surplus to first build an emergency fund so that when the car gives out or the dog requires an emergency trip to the vet, you are not thrown off course by the unexpected.Once the emergency fund has reached its goal (generally three to four months of spending), your surplus can then be invested.InvestmentYou can put your money in a term deposit and save it over your lifetime, but the reality is the nest egg you will have built at retirement based on bank interest rates will more than likely have only grown a small amount above inflation. Investment is about putting your money to work for you more efficiently.We work with you through sharemarket, property, business and some speculative investment to build your wealth. We only recommend speculative investment if it suits your risk profile and never to constitute more than 5% of your portfolio.Risk ManagementThe final piece of the plan is risk management. Risk management constitutes of insurance (to protect your income and ensure that if the unexpected happens from sickness, injury or death you and your family are still kept on track) as well as estate planning.KiwiSaverUnlike some planners, KiwiSaver is not a core part of our financial planning model. We see KiwiSaver as an additional insurance policy. If over the lifetime of your plans, your investments do not perform at expected levels or there are issues with income, KiwiSaver can act as a top up. And if everything has gone perfectly, it gives you a great bag of cash for the best possible lifestyle at retirement.It’s Simple:• We work with you to build a budget so that you have a surplus of cash with every pay• We build a reserve fund to ensure you are not thrown off track• We invest the surplus for greater returns• Insurance protects your plan if something goes wrongIf you would like to have a conversation about financial planning, please email info@foxplan.nz to arrange a meeting with one of our planning staff.The views and opinions expressed in this newsletter are not intended to be a personalised service for an individual retail client.

February 2024 - Quarterly Investment Update,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1707102458530-J4UG2FRZL9VJVW3XOZCG/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"Good Afternoon,As we bid farewell to the delightful chaos of Christmas, we eagerly step into the threshold of a brand new year, brimming with possibilities and promise and as always we thank you for being part of the FoxPlan Family.We are pleased to enclose our Summer update covering the period from October 2023 – December 2023 In 2023, media attention was dominated by issues like ram raids, law and order, the cost of living crisis, and conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, overshadowing positive investment market performance. Despite volatility, investment markets, including Australian, emerging market, and international developed shares, delivered double-digit returns, and previously weak bond markets rebounded.Looking forward to 2024, if it mirrors 2023's market performance with a more positive news flow, it could be an optimistic year. Portfolios remain well diversified, ready to capture returns wherever they may arise. In times of market unpredictability, the recommended approach remains consistent: staying invested, maintaining diversification, minimizing costs, and exercising patience – a strategy successful strategic investors have applied for years.Global share markets experienced strong gains in the last quarter as expectations shifted towards a potential 'soft-landing' for the US economy. This optimism, known as the goldilocks scenario, led to a surge in share prices. Global bonds also benefited from expectations of lower US interest rates in 2024, causing bond prices to rise. Despite minimal changes in economic factors, the key driver was the shift in investor expectations, prompting a reassessment of asset valuations and pushing prices higher. The positive change in expectations provided a tailwind for markets in the fourth quarter of 2023.Within the update, the Market Commentary section provides an overview of the previous quarter and highlights several areas of interest – inflation, migration and the magnificent 7A more detailed summary of International, Emerging Markets, NZ and Australian Shares can be found in the Key Market Movements Section.The featured article by Consilium titles ‘2023: Another year that defied the experts’ takes a retrospective look at 2023, the biggest major headlines and the forecasts that followed and discusses lesson we can take into 2024.

"Why a Reserve Fund Changes the Way You Think, Invest, and Live",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/fc89399f-d085-4fcc-bf66-abf8f0b58527/Dollars_Sense_Podcast_Logo.jpeg?format=original,"As we kick off 2026, we wanted to highlight a topic that is absolutely fundamental to long-term financial success: the reserve fund. On the latest episode of Dollars and Cents, I sat down with my colleague Sheldon Wu to unpack why this simple strategy is often overlooked, and why it’s more powerful than many realise.At its core, a reserve fund is a pool of money you set aside for emergencies. Financial planners like David Ramsey and Scott Pape (The Barefoot Investor) all emphasise its importance, recommending three to six months of either expenses or income. But beyond these textbook definitions, the real magic of a reserve fund is psychological.Most clients understand the logical benefits of having money set aside—it covers you if income stops or unexpected expenses arise. But the psychological shift it creates is even more profound. Having a reserve fund gives you confidence, reduces financial anxiety, and allows you to take calculated risks in other areas of life, including investments, career moves, and business decisions.Sheldon and I explored why this is often the most underrated strategy in financial planning. It doesn’t produce instant results, and people often find the target amount intimidating. For example, someone earning $150,000 a year aiming for a three-month reserve fund of $36,000 might feel like the goal is unattainable if they can only save a few hundred dollars a week. Yet, starting small, automating contributions, and gradually building the fund can make it manageable—and habit-forming.It’s also important to clarify what does not count as a reserve fund. Many people mistakenly rely on revolving credit, a credit card, or a single “all-purpose” savings account for emergencies. While these might provide temporary access to cash, they lack the psychological benefit of money that is earned, saved, and untouchable for non-emergencies. Using borrowed money or mixed-purpose savings defeats the purpose, often creating more stress when emergencies arise.The size of a reserve fund can also vary depending on life stage and purpose. My mentor, for instance, recommended that clients aiming for aggressive investment strategies maintain up to $100,000 in a liquid, untouchable account. This level of security allows them to invest boldly, take advantage of opportunities, and weather setbacks without jeopardising daily living or long-term plans.Different money personalities experience unique benefits from a reserve fund. The Anxious Controller, for example, may track every dollar and hesitate to invest. Once a reserve fund is in place, they gain confidence to invest rationally and reduce anxiety. The High-Income Rationaliser, who tends to over-optimise returns and use leverage for safety, learns to accept that not all money needs to generate a return. Across personalities, the reserve fund cultivates discipline, delayed gratification, and a more rational, long-term approach to money.Implementing a reserve fund also comes with practical lessons. It requires living below your means, combating lifestyle creep, and creating a structured cash flow system. We recommend separating your bank accounts into at least three categories: fixed expenses, variable expenses, and goal-specific savings (including your reserve fund). Automation is key—set it up so contributions happen without thought, and keep the account psychologically “untouchable” to ensure it serves its purpose.Ultimately, a reserve fund is more than just a safety net. It is a confidence tool, a habit builder, and a financial enabler. It allows you to make decisions with courage, take opportunities in life and business, and invest more strategically, knowing that you have a secure fallback.In short, while it may not always get the attention it deserves, the reserve fund is one of the most powerful financial strategies. If you haven’t yet started one—or if your existing “emergency money” isn’t truly liquid, untouchable, or psychologically distinct—consider this your nudge to start building one. The benefits are not just financial—they’re transformational.To listen to the full discussion and hear real-world examples of how a reserve fund can change your financial mindset, check out the latest Dollars and Cents episode on Apple Podcasts or Spotify.Our first Dollars and Cents episode for 2026 is now live 🎧This week Sheldon and I tackle what we genuinely believe is the most underrated financial strategy there is: the reserve fund — not just from a textbook angle, but how it shapes confidence, behaviour, and long-term financial decisions.If you have a moment, I’d really appreciate your support:🔗 Listen on Apple Podcasts🔗 Listen on Spotify🔗 Engage on LinkedIn🔗 Share on Facebook",,"Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:51:51 +0000",info@foxplan.nz
Finding the right house,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579610578142-FDA4L4KNT78SDMTGQZWU/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"When buying a house, it’s likely to be one of the largest purchases you will ever make. You’ll will need to talk to your Mortgage Adviser, Lawyer, Valuer, Property Inspector and deal with the Real Estate Agent.It can be a pretty big deal.Whether you’re a first time buyer, a property investor, moving up as your family grows, or you’re looking for something smaller now the kids are gone, there’s a lot to think about.So don’t rush it. Take time to look around. Do your homework. Let us help you work out what you can realistically afford to spend on a mortgage. And the chances are that you’ll end up buying a house that’s right.In our opinion ‘Buying a House’ is simply part of a plan – a plan to live a purposeful life with meaning and wellness. Whether a home or an investment, property is simply a servant of the plan. In the appendices of this guide you can see what we mean – A total financial plan with property as a cornerstone of lifestyle and/or investment. So where do you start? First of all, you should probably take some time to have a good look at the properties that are available in the area that you‘d like to live or invest in. Check out your local property press, trademe.co.nz/property, realestate.co.nz and the real estate sections in the daily newspaper to get an idea of availability and prices.It’s probably a good idea to come up with a “wish-list” in terms of what you’re really looking for. Write up your list in two columns: e.g. “Must have”, “Nice to have”. New building versus older character? Low maintenance, move in and do nothing versus potential to renovate and add value? How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need? Do you want a big section with a garden and lots of potential for outdoor living.Make sure to ask your FoxPlan adviser for advice. If you are buying an investment property – complete an analysis report to determine financial viability.Look at lots of different properties. Visit open homes and get a feel for different real estate agencies. Maybe even take in an auction or two to get a bit more comfortable with the process.Understand that different ‘markets’ experience different anomalies, supply and demand can create various roadblocks to your achievement of ‘The Plan’.

First-home buyer success stories,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579469050776-ZQ3YC21X2WDE09KLW4W9/First-home+buyer+success+stories.jpg?format=original,"At FoxPlan we believe our lending team is first-class and two recent success stories demonstrate the lengths our team will go to when it comes to securing first-home finance.Setting the SceneOur team recently had a couple come to FoxPlan with a $105,000 deposit. The couple had approached two other mortgage brokers and their bank prior. They had heard the same thing from all three about their borrowing potential.They were told with their deposit; they could borrow five times the deposit amount to a total of $525,000 and if they wanted to borrow any more – their parents would have to gift them some cash. The couple had parents who desperately wanted to help but didn’t have any spare funds, they did however have a property in freehold (no mortgage).As anyone looking in the Wellington market knows right now, $525,000 will not purchase a lot of house – especially for a young couple looking to start a family.The OptionsOur mortgage adviser was able to put two options in front of the couple.The first option was second tier lending. Second tier lenders (such as credit unions and building societies) are not governed by such strict Reserve Bank regulations as Banks, allowing them more flexibility in offering home finance for couples with only a 10% deposit. They do however charge higher interest rates. At FoxPlan we use these lenders as a short-term solution to build up to 20% equity so that borrowers can return to bank rates as soon as possible.The second solution was to bring in the parent’s equity via a guarantee. By guaranteeing only a small portion of one property for $50,000, the couple were able to have an effective deposit of $155,000 borrowing up to $775,000 at standard bank rates! No gift was required and suddenly home ownership became a real dream. The couple are now pre-approved and actively house hunting.At FoxPlan it is about doing the right thing for the client – even if it means our mortgage advisers taking on more work to find solutions.Buy with a mateAnother successful case we had recently involved two young friends struggling to get into the Wellington market. Both had savings but were a long way off being able to purchase a property alone, so they pooled their resources together.Our mortgage advisers were able to assist them in securing bank finance with each party having individual payments towards the mortgage. Banks understand the market is difficult for first-home buyers and are increasingly more open to alternative finance arrangements.There is no escaping the truth that right now it’s hard to afford a home in Wellington but some creative thinking with the right mortgage adviser may well get you there a lot faster than you realise.

"First Home Buyers - The Budget, Banks, and a Bunch of Cap Increases",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/219cc0fc-e9fa-4a89-8bd3-e9f6f2b46e44/budget.jpg?format=original,"In today’s market, where house prices are skyrocketing and banks have large deposit requirements, there are many people wondering whether home ownership is right for them. And you know what? That’s fine! There are other ways to build wealth that do not involve buying a home. For most New Zealanders the dream of owning a home does live on, especially among 18 – 39-year-olds “Generation Rent” want to buy property to live in. We know the housing market feels nearly impossible to approach right now, but there’s still hope. To start, you need to know where to look for help and what to be prepared for and we have started with a brief overview of the 2022 Budget. The 2022 BUDGET and what it means for First Home Buyers? Budget 2022 sees more New Zealanders able to access support to get into their first home because of changes to First Home Grants and First Home Loans. House price caps are being removed entirely from the First Home Loan, which will hopefully provide a larger choice of homes for prospective first home buyers. The First Home Grant will also have increasing house price caps for new and existing properties.What does Foxplan think?“This is welcomed news for first home buyers. The Cap was previously very restrictive and unrealistic. This change hopefully gives all kiwis the chance to own property”.What are the New Price Caps for First Home Grants? Wellington The cap rises to $750,000 for existing properties and $925,000 for new builds.Christchurch The cap rises to $550,000 for existing properties and $750,000 for new builds.Auckland The cap rises to $875,000 for existing and new builds Queenstown-LakesThe grant cap will lift to $875,000 for existing properties and $925,000 for new builds.Tauranga The cap will be $800,000 for an existing property and $875,000 for a new build.Hamilton The cap rises to $650,000 for existing properties and $725,000 for new builds.Its important to note that the house price and income gap will be reviewed every six months to make sure they are up to date. What First Home Products are available?So now you know the price caps, what exactly is a First Home Grant and a First Home LoanThe First Home Products support first home buyers to overcome the deposit barrier to home ownership. The Grant provides a subsidy for first home buyers to put towards a deposit and the Loan reduces the minimum deposit required.First Home Grant – up to $10,000 to put towards a deposit for eligible first home buyers who have been contributing to KiwiSaver for at least three yearsFirst Home Loan – reduces the deposit requirement to 5% for eligible first home buyersThe First Home Products can sit alongside other initiatives to support first home buyers, including:the Progressive Home Ownership Scheme, KiwiBuild programme,First Home Partner.Changes to the First Home Grant came into effect on 19 May 2022.Changes to the First Home Loan take effect from June 2022. What does Foxplan think?“These changes mean that people who were falling short with their deposits may have some options available to them. We encourage anyone either starting their first home buying process or just having a look to chat with the experts. Some people do not know what’s available to them!” How much deposit will I need to buy my first home?Currently, if you're buying your first home, you'll need at least a 20% deposit (or 40% if you're buying an investment property). As the average house price in New Zealand ranges from $500,000 in the rural areas to more than $1 million in large cities like Auckland, you might need to estimate having at least $200,000 to spare.Why not book to chat to one of our Mortgage Experts who can help wrap your head around these new changes?",Let us break down what the 2022 budget means for you and buying your first home,"Tue, 31 May 2022 02:28:12 +0000",GuestUser

Russia, Ukraine and a Lesson in Diversified InvestingIn the midst of such turmoil, markets have operated exactly as they should. Global uncertainty has increased.

FoxPlan's Spring Investment Update,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1572898199846-TN33ZC7XMKVI5HAG35CI/Warwick-Walker-2-1.jpg?format=original,"FoxPlan's Spring Investment UpdateThis week we have presented content from our Monthly Investment Newsletter. Click HERE to read the entirety of our Spring Quarter update.It has been another interesting quarter.Diversified portfolios continued to perform very well despite the media’s best efforts to have us all running for the hills.It's true - there continues to be some large uncertainties in the world - we are reminded of them every day in print and on television. But that’s not always relevant when it comes to investment performance.Even though we don’t yet know how or when Brexit will eventually occur, or how the China/USA trade war will play out, market participants around the globe accept that these issues are real and have priced in the elevated risks they represent.When we talk about something being ‘priced in’, we mean the market’s collective expectations or predictions about the future are already built into securities prices today.Why is this relevant? Well, let’s consider an example based on the mid 2016 vote in the UK, which resulted in their surprise decision to leave the EU.Immediately after the vote, UK shares and the value of the British pound both took a hit. In the short term, market prices reacted quite sharply to this previously unanticipated news. Markets reacted because they had only priced in a low probability of the ‘Leave’ vote winning.Fast forward to today, and the idea that the UK is leaving the EU is not new information. We’ve known about it for more than three years, but even today no one can be entirely sure of how Brexit will happen and what the precise consequences will be.The ongoing speculation today is mainly about whether it will be a hard Brexit (no deal with the EU) or a soft Brexit (a negotiated deal). Perhaps there is even still a very remote chance that the UK might have a new election, a new referendum, and not ever leave. But after three years of uncertainty on this issue, the markets are highly sceptical that Boris Johnson (the new UK Prime Minister) can pull a rabbit out of a hat and negotiate a leave deal acceptable to both the EU and the UK. This scepticism is factored into the market prices of UK securities in particular, and global securities more broadly.But, for the purposes of this thought exercise, let’s imagine what would happen if there was a rabbit residing in Boris Johnson’s hat. If the UK could somehow reach a favourable leave agreement with the EU, then this would probably be regarded as a much better outcome than market participants currently expect. In that scenario, the UK would leave the EU and UK securities prices, and share markets in general, might actually go up.And that’s the point we need to continue to remind ourselves. Bad news or uncertainty is quickly factored into market prices as soon as we know about it. Even our collective expectations about the future are priced in.To read the rest of our Q3 Investment Summary click HERE.

FoxPlan's Winter Investment Update,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579468762375-B6263W7Y2EJ446I3KXDN/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"This week we have presented content from our Monthly Investment Newsletter. Click HERE to read the entirety of our Winter Quarter update.Overall, the three months from April to June represented another good period for investors in risky assets. Although, as per usual, a critique of the global environment over the period doesn’t provide an obvious explanation of why that should be the case. Some of the largest issues facing markets remained as unresolved at the end of the quarter as they had been at the start. In that category were –• what sort of Brexit deal (if any) the UK government will end up securing;• the outlook for global interest rates and inflation;• if there is ever going to be an end to the US/ China trade war; and• if there is an end to the trade war, what will be left standing when the smoke clears?This should only remind us that the reason markets, in aggregate, go up is often unrelated to these sorts of issues. It’s usually not about politics, the direction of interest rates, economic growth rates, or even conflict. Yes, those elements (and others) can each influence investor behaviour and, to that end, they can have some short-term impact on whether prices are being bid higher or lower.However, the more common reason markets go up is that global commerce continues to function, even when times are uncertain. Regardless of what Donald Trump tweets, McDonald's continues to sell Big Macs. Regardless of whether or not the UK remains in the European Union or the trade war ends, we will continue to put petrol in our cars and pay for our phones, food, entertainment and clothing.Of course, the actions of central bankers, politicians and regulators can all have an impact on whether we feel more or less confident about what lies ahead. That can be very important, as it can influence what (and how much) people are prepared to spend their money on. If the future looks much less certain, we might decide to cut back on luxuries and save a little bit more. Perhaps we carpool. Perhaps we have a staycation rather than a vacation.But overall, unless uncertainty and fears are so high that we significantly change our collective consumer behaviour, most of us will generally continue to live our lives tomorrow in much the same way as we do today. And the businesses and service providers that we utilise in our day to day lives will continue to benefit.To read the rest of our Q2 Investment Summary click HERE.

Group Health Insurance is investing in your employees,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579609552910-BTBWU5YZ18JEP0GHBEZO/Group+Health+Insurance+is+investing+in+your+employees.jpg?format=original,"Retaining staff is a challenge faced by all Kiwi employers, no matter how big or small. The current employment climate with its low unemployment and rising wages is amplifying the challenge for many businesses as staff review their options and take increasing responsibility for their own career paths.Flexible hours, working from home and extra leave arrangements can all assist employers in retaining their staff but at FoxPlan we believe Group Health Insurance (GHI) is the missing key in the HR strategy of most SME’s across New Zealand.What is Group Health Insurance?GHI is a Health Insurance policy taken out and paid by the employer on behalf of their employees. If an employer has five or more employees, they can access a GHI product.There are three areas of cover that can be included. Basic packages will provide Hospital Cover only (for surgical or related hospital costs). Cover can also extend to Specialists/Tests (for specialist consultations) and Primary Care (benefits cover including GP visits, pharmaceutical, dental and optical treatments/procedures). The level of cover offered can be tailored to the needs of each employer.What are the benefits of Group Health Insurance?Pre-existing conditions: for most New Zealanders dealing with an existing health condition there are very few avenues open to them for private health insurance coverage, and the available options are expensive. GHI provides immediate pre-existing conditions cover outside of standard policy exclusionsWaived stand down periods: the standard 90 day stand down period to claim for benefits/specialist cover is waived under GHICover for immediate family members of employees: policy concessions can be extended to immediate family members of employees if they are added within 90 days of policy commencement or marriageACC/NIB partnership: delays in obtaining surgical treatments can occur whilst an ACC claim is reviewed. NIB have agreed with ACC that, if a claim is approved, they will consider covering the cost of treatment and then claim back the expense from ACC. This means treatment is completed as soon as possible and your employee can return to work soonerDoes Health Insurance even pay?The days of submitting a claim form, making multiple calls to follow up and waiting weeks for action are done with health insurers. The internet has been a disruptive force and has forced insurers to improve their customer service. Our partners at NIB allow your employees to claim directly from their smartphone via their app, have a NZ wide network of accredited providers to speed up the claims process and allow you to request a pre-approval online so there is peace of mind before any treatment.During 2017 alone, a record $1.185 billion was paid in health insurance claims within New Zealand.FoxPlan can provide you the assurance that your GHI scheme will not just act as a value add to retain your employees, but at life’s moments of truth when a claim comes, that the policy will be there to deliver. Email Sally Killick at sally.killick@foxplan.nz to discuss how to get your GHI policy in place today.The Fine PrintClaim payments by insurers are subject to claim approval as well as the terms and conditions of the policy.

Guide to buying an apartment,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579610126163-V2WC3KZ8J24EGKV58RUX/Guide+to+buying+an+apartment.jpg?format=original,"When buying an apartment, it’s likely to be one of the largest purchases you will ever make. You’ll will need to arrange & talk to your professional team Mortgage Adviser, Lawyer, Valuer, Property Inspector and deal with the Real Estate Agent.It can be a pretty big deal.Whether you’re a first time buyer, a property investor, moving up as your family grows, or you’re looking for something smaller now the kids are gone, there’s a lot to think about.So don’t rush it. Take time to look around. Do your homework e.g. due diligence. Let us help you arrange a professional team & work out your ‘due diligence’ and what you can realistically afford to spend on a mortgage. And the chances are that you’ll end up buying an apartment that’s right. Here's a few more things to consider before running out and purchasing an apartment. 1. Disclosure, disclosure As a prospective purchaser you must be given the following, from the seller / Real Estate agent, containing important ‘due diligence’ details that can impact your buying decisionA pre-contract disclosure statement (PCDS) either before entering into a Sale & Purchase agreement or at least 5 working days before settlement, &An Additional Disclosure Statement (ADS) within 5 working days from the purchaser request.The disclosure contains the following annual body corporate levy, funds held by the body corporate, upcoming maintenance on the complex, and whether it has any weather tightness problems. NBS ratingBefore settling on the property you get another disclosure statement covering things like any fees and charges relating to the unit and whether there are any proceedings pending against the body corporate. 2. And more disclosure – especially Body Corp insurance On top of that you should ask for additional documents, such as the body corp minutes of meetings, financials and information on insurance e.g. National Building Standard (NBS) rating for the apartment. Some apartments are difficult or very expensive to insure that are included in the body corp fees. The seller / body corp is entitled to charge you for this. 3. Sanitised body corporate minutes Bodies corporate have a tendency to keep things out of their meeting minutes that may reduce the attractiveness of the property e.g. maintenance that has not been done & deferred. That is why it’s important to get copies of the minutes, the financials and the budgets going back three years. 4. Upcoming general meetings If a unit goes on the market just before an extraordinary general meeting or an AGM at the complex, ask why the owner is selling at that time. There could be looming issues that they’re aiming to avoid. 5. Check there’s an adequate long-term maintenance plan (LTMP) Complexes must have an LTMP, but it only has to be for a minimum of 10 years, and it doesn’t have to be funded. A decade is not long enough because most of the big-ticket items such as the roof or the cladding won’t need replacing within that time. Owners should also be contributing to a long term maintenance fund so that the cash is there when this work needs doing. 6. And if you’re buying off the plans As house prices continue to skyrocket, securing a property while it’s still in the pipeline is tempting. But lobby group Consumer says get excellent legal advice first. Check if there have been any problems with other projects the developer has done, and find out if it has the necessary resource and building consents before paying anything. Check your contract has a “sunset clause” which allows you to cancel and get your deposit back if the developer hasn’t made sufficient progress within a certain timeframe. Also look out for “entire agreement” clauses which are usually designed to prevent you from relying on anything you were told by the sales rep. Make sure final payments are tied to the developer getting a Code of Compliance Certificate for the completed development. 7. Leaky buildings – how do you tell? Apart from the obvious of considering the era of the building – early 1990s to mid 2000s is the danger zone – and getting a property inspection done, there are often clues in the body corporate minutes. Problems with individual units are one sign. You’ll quite often see discussion about maybe a deck that’s leaking, and it would be portrayed as an isolated issue for one unit. Where you see that happening, that generally should raise a red flag. Remember there's plenty more to purchasing property than just these few tips above. Get in touch to talk in further detail and let us guide you through the process.

Have you checked your KiwiSaver contributions?,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579457795936-ZD8XWZYGHWO9SGKWL1Y0/Have+you+checked+your+KiwiSaver+contributions.jpg?format=original,"Earlier this year, Kiwis gained the ability to access new contribution rates towards their KiwiSaver fund. In addition to the 3%, 4% and 8% rates of salary, we can now also contribute 6% or 10% towards our fund. A new survey this week, however, has found that only around 6% of people are taking advantage of these new contribution rates.This week we’re illustrating the difference changing your contribution rate can make over a working lifetime.Meet JaneJane is 25 years old and currently earns $45,000 a year. She has a KiwiSaver fund balance of $6,000 and is contributing only the minimum 3% of salary to her KiwiSaver. Her fund is a growth type which means it is moderately aggressive with a longer-term time horizon.We will make some very conservative assumptions and assume that over Jane’s career she never sees another pay rise apart from annual inflation adjustments.If Jane keeps contributing at 3%, she will end up with approximately $833,000 at age 65: If we hold our assumptions but Jane now decides to contribute 6% instead of 3% of salary, she retires as a millionaire with just under $1.2m in the bank: If Jane decides to get extremely serious about saving and puts a full 10% of her salary into KiwiSaver, her retirement balance now falls just a bit short of $1.7m: The Dollar SumsThere are major differences in the level of return that can be achieved through higher rates of contribution, that’s obvious. What makes it starker is looking at the actual dollar value contributed out of Jane’s paycheck over her working career:3%: $80,6436%: $161,28510%: $268,809The majority of growth in her KiwiSaver fund is achieved through market growth. Employer contributions and tax credits are other (much smaller) factors.If Jane contributes an extra $80,000 to her KiwiSaver over her working life at 6%, she has earned an additional $370,000 at age 65.If she contributes an additional $187,000 at 10%, she earns more than $800,000!Let's get it sorted for youAt FoxPlan, we’ve got the KiwiSaver specialists in-house to get your fund sorted.

Have you checked your PIR?,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579607711057-ZCWZQZ8KNZDG12JHSKWK/Have%2Byou%2Bchecked%2Byour%2BPIR.jpg?format=original,"You have likely heard the news earlier this month that on the back of the IRD’s new tax refund system being implemented, 450,000 taxpayers were identified as paying the wrong PIR tax rate on their KiwiSaver.Unfortunately for those impacted, any shortfall in tax will have to be paid directly out of pocket as the legislation does not allow for it to be deducted against the remaining balance in a KiwiSaver fund. This will be a most unwelcome surprise!In addition to those affected for underpayment, if you have overpaid tax on your KiwiSaver there is currently no mechanism for refunding this. When you enroll in to KiwiSaver for the first time you likely will be allocated into a default fund which will charge the highest tax rate possible.This week we talk about PIR and how to make sure you are not caught out by the IRD in 2020.What is PIR?If you invest in the stock market within New Zealand, your investment will usually be a Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE). PIE investments have special tax rules which allow investors to be taxed at a lower rate than on their personal income. PIE investments also mean that the capital gain (or loss) on New Zealand shares (and some Australian) is not taxed. Your PIE will also pay tax on your behalf, so you do not need to declare PIE income on your tax return.KiwiSaver is a form of PIE.For your PIE to pay tax on your behalf, you must select one of the three different tax rates available, this is known as the Prescribed Investor Rate (PIR).Essentially when done right, PIE’s and PIR’s make your tax life a lot easier by allowing you to set and forget.PIR’s and Rules of ThumbThe three available PIR tax rates and general rules of thumb for income levels that apply to these are:• 10.5%: Should only be chosen by those with an annual income below $14,000• 17.5%: For those with an income between $14,000 to $48,000• 28%: For those with an income $48,000+Check Your PIROur partners at Booster have a handy flowchart which can be accessed HERE to help you calculate your PIR. If you are already with Booster and wish to check your PIR, simply click ‘My Details’ after logging in.With most other KiwiSaver providers you should also be able to access your PIR after logging in to their online portal otherwise you may need to give them a call.If you would like to check or update your PIR and/or have a discussion about KiwiSaver, please email info@foxplan.nz to arrange a meeting with one of our KiwiSaver team.The views and opinions expressed in this newsletter are not intended to be a personalised service for an individual retail client.

Have you got a Charity Investment Plan?,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579607838145-EYHACLNBIMY89V68BQUD/Have%2Byou%2Bgot%2Ba%2BCharity%2BInvestment%2BPlan.jpg?format=original,"New Zealand is the second most charitable nation on Earth and in 2014 we donated over $1.53 billion to worthy causes. Our giving nature is a fundamental part of the Kiwi ethos and we are always happy to pitch in and help when the need arises.But giving isn’t always easy. Once you are on a donor list there are often follow up appeals and calls for further donations. Trying to verify charities can be a time-consuming task and many good organisations simply do not have the resources to demonstrate the tangible changes that have occurred from your contribution.FoxPlan through the Gift Trust are able to offer a solution in the form of a Charity Investment Plan.What is it?The Gift Trust are a not-for-profit charity operating in New Zealand since 2009. Their mission is to help donors give more meaningfully. The Gift Trust provides vetting services, advice and tax planning to ensure that donors can create the difference they want to see in the world.A Charity Investment Plan begins with donors setting up an account with The Gift Trust. Donors can then donate to their trust account at any time on a regular or one-off basis (once a donation is made, it is irrevocable). Donors will receive a tax credit receipt at the time of donation and the funds are then invested by The Gift Trust into a fund with an agreed risk profile (like a KiwiSaver fund).When a donor has decided on a charity that they want to donate towards, they simply instruct The Gift Trust to donate. The Gift Trust will then perform due diligence (such as the nature of giving, charity status etc.) to approve the donation and pay funds accordingly.The Benefits• Through the Gift Trust, donors can choose to make their contributions anonymous – eliminating follow up appeals and requests.• The Gift Trust also will provide vetting services to ensure charity work is above board, and where donations are significant - the tangible results and records of what your contribution has achieved.• The Gift Trust provide planning around tax to maximise the use of donation tax credits (as up to 1/3rd of donations can be rebated).• By using an investment model, funds can grow beyond the immediate cash contribution to The Gift Trust. Any growth is tax free as well due to their charitable nature.• Funds can be invested across multiple risk profiles from conservative to growth portfolios. There are also socially responsible investment options (click here to read about SRI).• The Trust can review charities across New Zealand and also facilitate donations to international charities.Put simply, The Gift Trust simplify the process of giving and provide reassurance.How do I get started?If you would like to put a charity investment plan in place, email the team here at FoxPlan and one of our advisers will work with you to maximise your charitable giving.Click here to read more material from The Gift Trust.The views and opinions expressed in this newsletter are not intended to be a personalised service for an individual retail client.

Connect with Aidan on LinkedIn HERE.We often hear the phrase “good with money” being thrown around, usually in a negative sense talking about “not being good with money” – Impulse purchases, spending first and saving what’s left (more than often, not a lot). But what does it mean to be good with money?Well..It used to be a lot easier to be ‘good with money’ than it is now, credit card debt was low (or non-existent), most people used cash and the cost of living was much lower. Our current reality is much different, it’s not easy to save money and still live what we might call a ‘normal’ life.Being good with money isn’t something you can turn on or off – like any skill it takes practice. But fear not my friends, not all heroes wear capes - so here are four ways to help you be better with your money.1. Take advantage of your employers KiwiSaver matchYour employer must match your KiwiSaver contributions to 3% - some will also match your contributions past this point too.It’s FREE MONEY! Who doesn’t like free money?If you’re on 52k a year, that’s around $30 a week / $1,560 a year / $62,400 over 40 years (and that’s before any market returns, growth or increases in pay).2. Have a MOJO fund (some emergency savings)Sad truth is being poor is expensive. Miss a direct debit or go into overdraft and the banks won’t hesitate to charge a bunch of crazy fees. If you don’t have much money to begin with and your savings are earning little interest, you’re just one car won’t start day away from a world of financial pain.For people my age (22) it’s about getting your habits right to get three months’ worth of expenses saved in the bank (rent/bills/food/everything). Call it a bucket of mojo (cheers Barefoot) to use in case of emergency – no, a trip to the Gold Coast because Grabaseat has cheap flights isn’t an emergency.A large bank balance doesn’t bring happiness but saving does because;Saving = FreedomWhen you’ve got cash in the bank or cash under your mattress, you have the power, you call the shots.3. Know when something is too good to be trueGet rich fast – if we could all do it, we would. Reality is though when something seems too good to be true it usually isn’t.The best advice I can give is when you’re planning on doing anything with your money to try make more money – if there’s doubt in your mind that it might be too good to be true then you’re probably right. Listen to that little voice inside your head.This is where advice is super important too. Not advice from your brother, neighbour or dog but rather independent advice – I recommend you speak with a financial adviser like myself. Citizens Advice Bureau are an awesome free resource for Kiwis as well.4. You can save for purchases instead of using debt (it’s not impossible)We’ve all got a bit of an instant satisfaction habit – why wait 4 weeks to save for something when we can have it now? Afterpay and interest free buy now/pay later options are everywhere.Reality is unless you’re very disciplined and use these options very rarely, these options can feed our bad habits and make us ‘comfortable’ with being permanently in debt. Before we know it, we are in the deep end of the pool and just trying to keep our head above water.Ask yourself before you buy:What value does this item add to the quality of my life?Will I still get this same level of value in 6 months? 12 months? 2 years?If it’s worth it, split the cost over a few weeks, set up a new account and put the funds in there each pay.SummaryBeing good with money is different in 2019 than 1970. With easy access to credit and the high cost of living plus many other factors, it’s hard to save. But you’ve got to start somewhere. Living within your means and focusing towards the future is vital. If you take my tips on board you’re probably at least 50% better off than your peers.If you want to chat further feel free to contact me at aidan.tewake@foxplan.nz.

How do I submit an offer on a house?,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579611007142-Q0NYGCDH3ZG4VPFI9UDP/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"When buying a home it is important to remain rational and to do your homework. A house is worth the maximum that someone is prepared to pay for it. The more information you have, the better position you will be in to make the right decision.When buying your first residential property or investment property it is no different. Take time to check out all the options, fees and obligations. Making an offer There are a number of methods of selling a house. Whichever way the house you want is being sold, this will affect the process you will have to go through to purchase that particular house. All offers to buy / sell property in NZ need to be in writing on a Sale & Purchase Agreement. Real Estate Sales agents and Lawyers are authorized to arrange S&P agreements. Buying by Offer and Negotiation This used to be the most common way to buy a house. When you have found the house you want, you make an offer to the vendor with the price you want to pay and any conditions you want to add (see later for details on these). The offer is presented to the vendor and is either accepted, rejected if it does not fit the vendors expectations, or a counter offer will be made. When this happens the agreement will be returned with items changed (usually the price and/or any of the other conditions such as settlement date). You then decide to accept it, reject it or make a counter offer of your own. This continues until one party accepts or rejects the offer.Key Difference: Your offer is negotiated back and forth until agreed between you and the vendor and it can be subject to conditions. Unfortunately this process of hands on negotiation has been replaced – Tender is now most common (in Wellington). Probably driven by the licensee of Real Estate agencies being required to comply with new regulations. Buying by Auction Vendors sell via auction where there is high demand and short supply of property. Hence why Auctions are more common in Auckland than elsewhere.Purchasing a house at auction is very different to any other method. When you bid at an auction and are successful you cannot negotiate further, it is unconditional at this point. You are buying ‘as is’. So unlike other methods you must do all your due diligence before the auction.It is very important when you go to an auction that you have everything sorted out first, such as Registering your interest with the person running the event (usually a real estate agent)Getting a registered valuation and any other reports that are needed done before the auction (ask your FoxPlan adviser to recommend the right company to do the reports for you)Have your FoxPlan adviser organise a pre approval of finance for you so you know the maximum you can borrowUsing the valuation, your budget and your pre approval to decide the maximum you want to pay for the houseHave your auction deposit (ie. down payment) ready to pay if you win the Auction – normally 10% of the purchase price. How does an auction work? A reserve price is set by the vendor (being the minimum they want for the house), which only the Auctioneer knows. If the highest bid is more than the reserve, the property is sold and a deposit is paid to the vendor. If the house does not reach the reserve then the vendor may enter into negotiations (as in method 1) with any of the bidders (usually the highest bidder initially).Key Difference: You are openly bidding against others on a specified date and time and place with the best bid winning, with no conditions (i.e. buy ‘as is’). Tenders – Open & Closed Tenders are now the most common way of selling a house (in Wellington).There are two types of Tenders: open and closed. An open tender is when the real estate agent can tell you what the other tenders are. With a closed tender they can’t tell you what the other tenderers are offering.When you are buying a house through tender you need to make a written bid for the property (by submitting a sale and purchase agreement to the Real Estate Agent). There will be a date (Tender date) by which all offers need to be made, so make sure you talk to the agent about when that is.The offers will be presented to the vendor and they will decide to accept any of them, reject all of them, or make a counter offer to one of them. As they are comparing your offer to others, you need to make sure you are thorough with the price you decide on, and any other conditions you want. The vendor is not obliged to take the highest price, and if a lesser offer has less or different conditions it may be more appealing to them.Key Difference: All buyers are to put their best offer forward by a set date (tender date) –with NO prior negotiation, and may have condtions attached on date. Vendor chooses the best offer.The tender processRegister your interest with the real estate agentGet a copy of the tender document which will outline how your tender should be made.Get your lawyer to look over the tender document before you submit it.Decide on the price you want to pay and any conditions you want on the offer.If you want to strengthen your offer you may want to complete reports before the tender day.Submit your tender. You may need to pay a deposit when you submit your tender. It will be refunded if your tender is not successful. FoxPlan Tip When borrowing to buy a house, the lender will lend against either the price or valuation, which ever is the lower. If the valuation is higher than the price then you have no problems, but if the price is higher then you will need to find the difference in the price and value yourself which may affect your deposit. So you need to make sure that you don’t offer too much, because if the value is not as high as your price you may have issues.

How much can you afford for a new home,,"Saving for a deposit Generally, you’ll need a minimum deposit of 5% of the purchase price. If you have 20% or more as a deposit, that’s even better, as the mortgage lender won’t normally require mortgage insurance to guarantee your loan.The larger your deposit, the less you’ll actually have to borrow and subsequently repay.If investing however rather than buying your own home your borrowing arrangements may be completely the opposite; 40% deposit, interest only mortgage. Plan appropriately in conjunction with your adviserLenders Ideally require a 20% deposit of the purchase price. This is low risk for the lender to get their money back from the sale of security (mortgagee sale) as a last resort.For owner occupied homes, lenders can approve loans with less than 20% deposit. –called “low equity” borrowers . Lenders can approve loans with as little as 5% deposit, although lending criteria is much tougher & more costly e.g. low equity fee / interest rate charge, no rate discounts or cash contributions offered.At least 5% of the deposit needs to be saved (e.g. from KiwiSaver) with the rest coming from elsewhere (e.g. gifted).For property investors, lenders require a minimum of 40% deposit (or equity). How much can you borrow? This is dependent on the different criteria of each lender. That can change on a daily basis. The following five key criteria determine how much you can borrow: CauseCharacterCapacityCollateralCapitalFor most lenders, an ideal borrower is one who has a good credit history, has a reasonable deposit and has an income that comfortably covers the mortgage payments.You can borrow around 95% of the purchase price (or valuation, which ever is the lower), but will generally have to pay Lenders mortgage insurance (also known as Low equity premium) if your deposit is less than 20%. Working out your budget Having a budget helps to get a reasonably good feel for your income and expenses. At application time, the lender will want to see some of the details of your expenses, so working them out with your adviser before hand will speed things up.The various mortgage lenders have their own formulas for working out whether they think you can afford the mortgage you are after. Your adviser will recommend the lender that most fits your situation, so that you are more likely to be approved.You can help your affordability by paying off any loans or hire purchases and having a low limit on your overdrafts and credit cards.FoxPlan Tip Your adviser can often get you a ‘pre-approval’, which is an undertaking from the bank as to the maximum you can borrow. This helps you know what your price limit is from the outset, and can give you some greater weight in negotiating.

How responsible is your KiwiSaver?,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/4cbc16c6-88bc-4b7b-869a-b289203de9a5/1696728434756.png?format=original,"Just a quick one from us this week - episode three of our podcast is out now! Socially responsible investment. Whatever your stance on the issue, it’s pretty clear it’s here to stay with billions of funds moving into responsible portfolios and funds.In a recent survey, almost three-quarters of Kiwi investors surveyed expected their investments to be managed with social responsibility mandates. 59% of Kiwis said they would change their KiwiSaver or investment funds if they didn't align with their values.What the survey results show us is that there is a huge shift towards responsible investing, and one we can only assume will increase with Gen X and Millennials seeing a massive transfer of wealth over the next few decades. One of the neat things about this movement is how accessible information is becoming, with sites like Mindful Money allowing you to compare how your KiwiSaver fund stacks up on a responsible level to other funds in the marketplace. So, how does your KiwiSaver fund perform compared to its competitors?",,"Wed, 04 Oct 2023 00:18:00 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
How to Build Wealth AND Enjoy Life -  Final Part 4,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/6caf3765-b3cb-49b3-9fcf-63b910161cef/Untitled+design+%2849%29.png?format=original,"Welcome back to the final leg of our “Building Wealth While Having Fun"" series. Today, we're getting real about the golden ticket to financial success – starting early. It's time for some no-nonsense talk on why kicking off your wealth journey as soon as you can is the real deal. The #1 Game-ChangerIf there was one last vital aspect to building wealth while enjoying your life, it would be starting early. Consistent savings and investments from early in your financial journey are a game-changer. Whether it's contributing to KiwiSaver, a managed fund or a simple savings plan, the power of dollar-cost averaging and compound interest can work wonders, and make building wealth while enjoying life significantly more manageable. Embracing the unpredictable nature of investment markets, especially when starting young, is a key principle for financial success. While the prospect of market downturns might seem daunting, it's essential to see them as opportunities rather than setbacks. During these down markets, maintaining discipline and continuing regular contributions to your KiwiSaver and/or managed fund can work to your advantage. Even with a reduced balance, consistent investments, whether it's $100 a fortnight or a monthly contribution, mean you're purchasing more units at a lower price – also known as dollar-cost averaging. As markets inevitably rebound as they always have in the past, you'll find yourself with a more substantial portfolio due to accumulating units during the market lows. Starting early with savings or investments is especially crucial for those in their 50s as understanding investment time frames is essential for planning beyond retirement (e.g. not running out of money). Series Summary ChecklistIn essence, building wealth while having fun necessitates a multifaceted approach. First, you must understand your money personality and steer clear of extremes like austerity or recklessness to ensure sound financial planning. Second, create goal-oriented accounts to foster clarity and prevent unexpected setbacks. Third, navigate the world of credit card rewards with caution, align your strategy with your money personality, and maintain financial discipline. Fourth and final, make it all easier on yourself by starting your wealth-building journey early, through strategic savings and investments. Set yourself up with good money habits while utilising the power of compound interest and dollar-cost averaging. Ultimately, building wealth and enjoying life at the same time can be a tough task, but we are here to assist you in your journey.

Income Protection Insurance Vs. ACC,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579468487487-WE000MJZ0Y4NVMK926Q2/Income%2BProtection%2BInsurance%2BVs.%2BACC.jpg?format=original,"Kiwis are lucky to have ACC in place. It’s a scheme that provides a basic level of assurance when it comes to our livelihoods and its structure means New Zealand avoids much of the personal injury type litigation associated with places such as the United States.ACC however is limited as to what it covers, and gaps certainly exist. This week we look at why Income Protection Insurance is so important and the differences between it and ACC.What is Income Protection Insurance?In the event you are sick or injured and unable to work (usually beyond a four-week stand-down period), Income Protection provides you a consistent payment up to a maximum of 75% your regular pay.This means you don’t have to raid the savings account, miss the critical bills like mortgage/rent or utilities and keeps pressure off your family and friends to cover your costs while you’re unable to work.Why not just use ACC/Welfare?ACC only provides cover where an accident stops you from working, it does not assist in the event of sickness. Another key aspect of ACC is that there is usually no cover available if a condition is pre-existing or degenerative.Income Protection provides far more extensive protections than ACC alone.The government does provide some support for those unable to work through the Supported Living Payment however this limited and means tested. Many families will simply be too wealthy for this benefit yet left in a situation where they are unable to afford to pay the mortgage, rent or power bills if a breadwinner is unable to work.Finally, it’s important to be aware the chances of a prolonged absence off work due to sickness are four times greater than that from an injury.Is it expensive?Buying an Income Protection Insurance Policy is much like buying a car. Avoiding the lemons is critical but most of us can’t afford a Tesla either. Our key tip is to work with a qualified Financial Adviser. They will provide you a Statement of Advice (SOA) when quoting Income Protection cover. The SOA should support their recommendation through independent research and recommend an appropriate solution within your means.Your cover can be tailored by the percentage of income covered, stand-down period or conditions insured.If you want to discuss Income Protection Cover or would like to review your existing cover please feel free to email info@foxplan.nz and one of our advisers will be more than happy to assist.

Inflation. What is it? What does it do and can it ever be a good thing?,,"More than likely you have read, heard and seen all the reports and articles about the rising cost of living and the impact it is having on the economy.At Foxplan over the past few weeks, we have been asked a few questions by both clients, staff, and advisers about inflation and the overall theme of these questions is:· What is inflation and how can I make my money work for me better in a time of rising costs? · Can inflation ever be viewed positively? · Do I need to worry about my investments? So, we thought - why not break inflation down and try to make it easier to understand! Inflation is the term used to describe a rise in average prices throughout the economy. Inflation is most commonly measured by the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI tracks the price of a large fixed ‘basket’ of goods and services such as: foodhousing and household utilitieshealthrecreation and cultureeducationcommunicationclothing and footweartransportalcoholic beverages and tobaccohousehold contents and servicesmiscellaneous goods and services.The CPI choose the items and determine their importance based on Kiwi spending patterns. The CPI ‘basket’ represents how Kiwi households spend their money. We’ve explained how Inflation is measured but what is it currently in New Zealand?The most current annualised inflation rate is 6.9% which is the highest it’s ever been in New Zealand since 1990! This means for the average Kiwi your weekly shop may increase, technology and other consumables cost more, basically put your dollar is worth less, so goods will cost more to buy. The underlying cause is usually that too much money is available to purchase too few goods and services, or that demand in the economy is outpacing supply. In general, this situation occurs when an economy is so buoyant that there are widespread shortages of labour and materials. People can charge higher prices for the same goods or services.Can higher inflation rates ever be a good thing?Inflation is generally viewed negatively but a little inflation can be healthy for stimulating an economy. It can boost consumer demand and drive economic growth. what can you do to mitigate the effects of inflation?Whilst you can’t avoid inflation, you can help plan for it and our advisers are on hand to help you with any questions you may have.However, during times of uncertainty and inflated prices, some companies may also experience staff shortages – this might be the best time to ask for a pay rise. If you haven’t reviewed your mortgage in a while, it may benefit you to have a chat with our mortgage adviser to check if your loan is still structured correctly to suit your current needs. If you are concerned about your future money plans or having enough in the pot to retire why not book a free discovery call with one of our financial advisers?","More than likely you have read, heard, and seen all the reports and articles about the rising cost of living and the impact it is having on the economy.

Interpreting Financial Babble,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/a11f98ea-552e-4d4e-a510-970d475ad6d1/portfolio+exposure+to+russia.png?format=original,"Thank you for reading this newsletter.As many of you may know, the markets have had a volatile start to the year with high inflation around the globe and recent geopolitical concerns in Eastern Europe. It’s times like these where we see investment analysts and commentary getting more and more airtime on the news.This can lead some to be concerned at a macro level regarding volatility in their portfolios, or at a more micro level with how might affect the cost of consumer goods in New Zealand.If you are invested in a Synergy or Consilium portfolio with us, the only allocation of your portfolios involved with Russia or Ukraine/Belarus is through the Emerging Markets funds, in both Standard and Socially Responsible mandates. Across all these portfolios, exposure ranges from 0.0% to 0.3%. The visual below illustrates the exposure to Russia in the standard 98/2 portfolio: Historically, such events as we are witnessing in Europe do have an impact on portfolios but these have typically been temporary as evidenced below, which shows the impact of Market Shock Events over the past century. From a New Zealand perspective, the extent of trade with both Russia and Ukraine is limited. Russian exports to New Zealand during 2020 were approximately US $252 million, overwhelmingly mineral fuels and oil. New Zealand exports to Russia consist primarily of dairy products and are of a similar order of magnitude in terms of value, while trade with Ukraine is insignificant (Select Wealth Management, 2022).FoxPlan’s role is to help you to stay focused on your goals whilst listening to your financial concerns, especially external factors. The research done by our Investment Partners is historical and evidence-based, rather than predictive. This means that we evaluate and understand a lot of financial information that in the media can be considered hype and sensation.Even fund managers are having a hard time sorting through the noise of the financial news. Imagine how confusing it must be for regular investors. Compounding the problem is that most don’t really read the full story. Nowadays people barely get past a quick glance at the headlines.For those tempted by this ‘headline surfing’ approach, here is a crash course in how to interpret what you are really reading. Some or all of these headlines might make you feel uncertain about your plan and the investment strategy designed to support it. As mentioned above, our role is to assist you to stay on track with your plan and remain confident that you have the correct strategy.

Investment Newsletter - August 2022,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1662007560243-6VE53YAKUHCKUHH0U8JJ/rider.png?format=original,"What is YOUR number?Having a target “number” for your retirement savings can help you understand just how big the mountain is. However, is that number sufficient to make sound financial decisions? In 2021, Massey University produced a retirement expenditure guideline for New Zealanders to illustrate potential retirement costs. The report outlines the weekly expenditure relative to NZ Superannuation in 2021, the key inflationary drivers for superannuants, and other factors to think about for retirement It is a great effort by them after speaking to hundreds of retired Kiwis, to then detail how much retirement might cost us. However, just adding the numbers up in isolation of your actual circumstances does not always provide the full picture. The numbers are a useful guide about costs, but cannot factor in your big spending goals, health, family gifting, your longevity, inflation and the state of our economy etc. So, your reality could deviate from the facts and assumptions of those who participated in the survey. Therefore, we believe advice isn’t just about looking at a single number as the end goal, it also encompasses new information, and how this integrates with your needs.As the years pass, changes could occur within your control, or many happen outside of your control. Therefore, with more information, the number may change, thus the need for regular reviews. From a psychological standpoint, purely focusing on having a “number” will potentially lead investors to view (the amount of) money as a destination, rather than the fuel to achieve goals. We perfectly understand why investors want to focus on a number. This is because money is a critical aspect of our lives and is embedded in our financial goals, such as purchasing a house, or retiring. However, our experience working with many investors over a long period of time is that money is not the destination, nor a real source of happiness. Instead, money is the means to help achieve financial goals, which is intertwined with your wellbeing and ultimately what makes you happy.When working with you, our job is to design the most appropriate strategy for your individual circumstances to help achieve those goals and take away the worry of running out of money. It may well involve a “number” to help plan how much to invest, the frequency and how it is allocated. We are mindful that this number could change with time. Therefore, the complexity of retirement planning is not justified by us asking “What’s your number?” as there will be numerous factors in play. We believe a more appropriate question will be ""What will make you happy when you retire?"".If you would like to discuss your situation with us, we are only a phone call or an email away. Please get in contact with us on 0800 NO STRESS (0800 667 873) or email at info@foxplan.nz if you have any questions or would like your adviser to talk through your current investment plan.",,"Thu, 01 Sep 2022 04:53:37 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
Investment Newsletter - August 2023,,"August Newsletter – Utilising markets to accumulate wealth Good Morning,As we continue to navigate the dynamic landscape of global capital markets, we wanted to share some insights from a recent article that sheds light on the various approaches to accumulating wealth. Money makes the world go round. In 2022, the total value of the global share markets exceeds $100 trillion NZD – around 400 times the GDP of New Zealand or 3.9 times the GDP of the United States. What better way to make money than to go where the money is? While there's no one-size-fits-all strategy for financial success, understanding the different strategies available to us can help us make informed decisions aligned with our goals. But a lot of people go about it wrong, or they get there too late. Therefore, it is important to seek advice from your financial adviser before stepping into something new. The article highlights ten ways to potentially accumulate wealth, ranging from challenging to more straightforward strategies. We have summarised them below, taking into consideration factors such as degree of difficulty, likelihood of success, and time required: 1. Find the next big thing! (Tesla/Amazon): This involves identifying cheap, innovative companies and holding on to their stocks until they make it big. Degree of difficulty: 10/10, Likelihood of success: 1/10, Time required: 5-20 years. 2. Create your own ‘next big thing’: Creating new investment vehicles or technologies can offer substantial rewards for the founders, but building and profiting from such innovations may take time. Degree of difficulty: 9/10, Likelihood of success: 2/10, Time required: on average 2-7 years. 3. Identify and jump on the next bubble (tulips/gold/cryptocurrency/personalised number plates): Profiting from market bubbles requires timing – buying in early and selling before the bubble bursts. Degree of difficulty: 8/10, Likelihood of success: 3/10, Time required: 1-5 years.4. Short stocks/markets: Betting against overvalued companies or markets can be profitable if timed correctly. This strategy demands strong nerves and a keen understanding of market sentiment (the attitude of investors in the market). Degree of difficulty: 7/10, Likelihood of success: 4/10, Time required: 6 months to 3 years. 5. Time the market: Attempting to predict share market trends can lead to success, though it's challenging to consistently get the timing right (just look at the long-term performance of most fund managers who actively manage money). Degree of difficulty: 6/10, Likelihood of success: 5/10, Time required: Whenever the next market correction occurs. 6. Provide a valuable service: Offering research, asset management, or unique insights to others can be lucrative if you can monetise your expertise. Degree of difficulty: 8/10, Likelihood of success: 7/10, Time Required: 7-12 years.7. Become a stockbroker: Skillful salesmanship, coupled with confidence and trust-building, can lead to substantial commissions. Degree of difficulty: 5/10, Likelihood of success: 9/10, Time Required: However long it takes you to successfully and regularly close trades.8. Index investing: Investing in the entire share market and holding long-term can yield reliable returns, but managing your behaviour can be challenging. Degree of difficulty: 5/10, Likelihood of success: 10/10, Time Required: 20-50 years.9. Dollar Cost Average (DCA): Regularly investing a fixed amount over time can lead to steady growth, particularly with diversified assets. Degree of difficulty: 3/10, Likelihood of success: 9/10, Time Required: 10-50 years.10. Compound forever (aka rarely sell): Allowing investments to compound over time, especially when reinvesting dividends or interest, can be a reliable path to wealth. Degree of difficulty: 2/10, Likelihood of success: 10/10, Time Required: Forever. At FoxPlan, we are advocates of asset class investing strategies i.e. using index-based funds and dollar cost averaging, therefore compounding your investments forever. Remember, the key to financial success lies in patience and a well-informed strategy tailored to your goals and risk tolerance. We are here to discuss these options in more detail and help you make decisions that align with your financial aspirations. Feel free to reach out to us to explore these strategies further.

Investment Newsletter - February 2023,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/4f3778a8-817e-451a-ade3-d3845229ef5a/f.jpg?format=original,"Staying the course & information hygieneGood afternoon,In this newsletter we want to cover two broad topics, titled “Staying the course” and “Information Hygiene”.During the floods and cyclone, the news published the effects and magnitude of the disasters, broadcasted live updates, reported how the government responded, and provided us data about the regions most affected. As days went by, news about the economy creeps in.“Flood impacts add challenges to inflation”“GDP will be severely affected”With all the information that we obtain, be it the news or click baits amplified by social media, should you change your investment plan to accommodate these externalities?Well… no.Similar to when markets fluctuate, we must resist the itch to switch your investment strategy. Your adviser will have taken into consideration what the long, medium and short-term strategies are in relation to your investment plan. Your investment plan should have anticipated and factored in volatility in the market. Therefore, straying away from the plan essentially means you will lose track of your what your investment is meant to be doing for your needs and goals. In turbulent times, financial news might seem to be getting more traction. Not surprising, given that the news act as a medicine for many. When we find out something has happened, we instinctively want to discuss it with family and peers, and dig deeper, to determine the many reasons, sometimes outside of our control of why this or that happened. This phenomenon is not unique to financial news. News on wars, natural disasters and pandemics experience the same “despair” similar to when the financial markets go down.In this newsletter, we will touch on two very serious matters that we believe every investor should be wary when seeing information on the web; scams and an influx of unfiltered financial information.First, is regarding investment scams. The New Zealand Financial Markets Authority (FMA) indicated that about 20% of the population has been targeted by investment scams. Among the latest, Kiwi investors have been warned not to trade with Validus, a company promising returns up to 300%, allegedly generated by professional traders trading in cryptocurrency, foreign currency and other financial products [1].A quick web search on “Investments” would show investment products that promotes a company’s promise of high returns, low fees, etc. While these features could look attractive, we must always perform some due diligence on the companies that offer these. While returns are a substantial factor in the investment planning and decision making, there are many other quantitative and qualitative factors that you must consider in choosing your investments. If you have any concerns or would like our opinion on something before you invest, please reach out to us and we can assist you. Secondly, scams are not the only information threat to investors. We can also see that the information being shared on social media encourages people into making impulsive decisions, or often times propagate a sense of “fear of missing out”, or more commonly known as FOMO. Due to the massive number of users on social media platforms, we must always be aware of unverified and unreliable information, and to some extent “opinions”. Social media has created a new type of celebrity, one that posts about financial advice, known popularly as “finfluencers” and they most often lack proper qualifications and are not registered with a regulatory body. They could offer “advice” on anything and everything, from purchasing real estate, to buying cryptocurrency.While is it a positive phenomenon that people can easily access information about finance and financial products, we must always keep in mind the reliability and trustworthiness of the information before acting on them. For example, a cryptocurrency investor could be displaying their wealth and returns on a good year, however, fails to mention the extreme volatility and risk associated with it, due to the fact they were paid to promote the investment product. Much like a punter at the horse races who only tells you about their wins. This ultimately highlights the value that a trusted financial adviser brings in; acting to filter and verify the information and using them to help you with your investment planning based on your needs and goals.In summary, there are some information hygiene habits that we ought to exercise to protect ourselves from straying away from your investment plan. These habits include the following:Exercise Skepticism if the investment opportunity seems too good to be true. If an investment product offers “high return, low risk” we should be wary of what the investment actually entails.Be cautious of opinions that you see and hear, particularly when the framework of the “investment advice” revolves mainly around the returns of an investment and not about the strategy, risk associated, and what the investment involves.Use trusted, established sources for financial information.Tighten your privacy control to avoid your information being leaked.Most importantly, seek out a licensed financial adviser for financial advice who understands your circumstances, needs, goals and risk appetites.We are only a phone call or an email away should you wish to discuss anything.

Investment Newsletter - November 2023,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/48b021a8-0b8f-433b-ab40-1dfe2c0a2cf4/Picture1.png?format=original,"Good Morning,As Christmas quickly approaches, we are excited to bring our last investment newsletter for the year!You may wonder why here in New Zealand we focus so much to what happens to shares in the United States. It is because the share market in the US has the most valuable companies in the world, which drove much of the growth around the world.The performance of the US share market in the past year can be described as “focused”, as there has been a relatively small number of shares driving the market higher.The so-called “Magnificent Seven”, a group of seven big technology companies, comprised of Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Tesla, has made the S&P 500 more concentrated than ever, representing over 25% of the value in the top 500 shares in the US.The average return of these seven companies this year is a gain of 109% (as of Nov 22, 2023), resulting in a 19% return for the S&P 500 index. This comes as a much-needed positive outlook after However, this high concentration in a few companies is a legitimate concern for investors because if these shares were to fall, the index would fall as well. Albeit the other parts of the index may make up for some of the losses.But has this high concentration always been the case?Hendrik Bessembinder, a professor at Arizona State University, conducted research into whether shares outperform Treasury bills (Treasury bills being very short-term government debt). His study found that over a period of 90 years, the return on shares is more concentrated on one side than the other. Point x represents 0% return. Anything to the left is negative returns and anything to the right is positive returns. In the diagram above, you can see that there are fewer data points that land on the right-hand side of point x.The findings show that the returns from long-term share investing are positively skewed, indicating that there are observations on one of the extreme ends of the distribution of returns. This means that a few shares with outsized returns pull up the average return of the market. Bessembinder also found that over the 90-year period from 1926 to 2017, just 86 shares accounted for over half of the wealth creation in the US share market.The key takeaway from this research is the need for diversification since no one knows what the next big winner will be.So, what does this tell us about the Magnificent Seven shares and what does it mean for you?Outsized gains are normal.Other shares will typically pick up the slack.Concentration can make you a killing or it could kill your investment.Therefore, it is important to adopt a multiple asset class investing strategy to diversify your investments so you can capture both the winners and the losers, while not being too exposed in each of these areas.

Investment Newsletter - September 2022,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/f8432284-db69-425f-97cd-ae673eabc64c/f.jpg?format=original,"September NewsletterGood Afternoon,In the words of Paul Samuelson, an American economist,“Investing should be more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow. If you want excitement, take $800 and go to Las Vegas.”- Paul SamuelsonPaul was the first American to be awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for his outstanding contributions.But why should investing be a slow, long process? If our investments go up, shouldn’t we quickly sell the investments to avoid the investments going back down? Why should we risk riding volatility in the market? In this newsletter, we will touch on delayed gratification and the studies that surround this.In an era of instant responses and speedy deliveries, we have now become accustomed to things being fast, quick and prompt. From the moment we wake up, we can do a quick search on the internet, and it would show us today’s weather forecast, traffic details and the latest news, all while sipping freshly prepared instant coffee.It gives us instant satisfaction when we obtain what we want in mere seconds. This is not exclusive to the tangible items in our daily lives. Even financial markets experience this phenomenon. People feel euphoric when the value of their investments go up, and then quickly sell the investments to capture the profit they have made. On the other side of the token, a sense of panic kicks in and people sell their investments after seeing the markets drop. Both are fundamental investment mistakes: Euphoria, and Panic. The worse of these is Panic.Not knowing, they could miss out on potentially greater returns if they view investments as part of their long-term plan.An experiment was conducted in 1972 by a professor at Stanford University aimed to study delayed gratification. Children were given the option, either to have one marshmallow right now, or two marshmallows if they waited for a while. In follow-up studies, the researchers found that children who were able to wait longer tended to have better life outcomes, which were measured by SAT scores, educational attainment, and many other measures. How does the Stanford Marshmallow experiment relate to investing?Example: Let’s take the S&P 500 index in 2020 for perspective. Let’s say you invested in the S&P 500 on the first trading day of 2020. There are two scenarios:Scenario 1 – Quickly sell to realize your gainsIf you sold on 09/02/2020, just before the stock market crash due to the pandemic. You would have gained: 4.18%. Not bad.Scenario 2 – Wait until the end of the yearIf you held on to the investment until the last trading day of the year, you would have gained: 15.76%. Throughout the year, you may have experienced a very volatile market; a very sharp decline early in the year and then the stock market went to all-time highs.But this is a one-year timeframe, let’s look at a 21-year timeframe, starting from January 2000 until December 2020. S&P500 1 January 2000 - 31 December 2020You invested in the S&P 500 on the first trading day of the year 2000. There are two scenarios: Scenario 1 – Selling your investments mid-wayIf you sold your investments halfway through the period on, the first trading day of 2010, you would have lost 24%.Scenario 2 – Wait until the end of the periodIf you held on to the investment until the last trading day of the 21-year period, you would have gained: 155.65%. Throughout the period, you have experienced at least 5 bear markets, in which the S&P 500 had more than a 20% decline.While there is never certainty surrounding investments, we can use past data to project what investments might do. The key is to not be impulsive, but rather look at how your investments have done in the long-term. Our part as financial advisers is to assess and assimilate knowledge on financial markets to your investment planning. From there, we monitor the efficacy of the plan and the investments it entails.

Is Inflation Deflating Your Finances?,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1661319184631-7BYZG2NH7AL7IGAL4BLM/inflation+deflation.png?format=original,"There is no magic solution to avoid the rising cost of living in New Zealand. With inflation at a 32 year high on the back of expensive housing, food and fuel costs rising, there is no denying that it is financially a difficult time for many people. However as financial advisers, we have a few strategies that may help reduce the effects of inflation on your bank accounts and investments.Clearly understand where your money is going - we recommend revising your bank statements so you can see exactly how you’re spending your money, and how that spending compares to a few months ago. Once you have your spending revised, it’s easier to see where you’re overspending and where to redirect more funds.~ Remember, Save first, spend second! ~Write everything down - Whether it’s writing a note on your phone or handwriting a list, it’s important to keep a detailed record of where your money is going as this helps you visualise your cash flow and cut back on unnecessary spending.~ Visualising your future goals can help keep you on course. Which is exactly what financial planning is! ~Start prepping your meals - Set aside some time to prepare and make a weeks’ worth of meals with seasonal and affordable ingredients to reduce overspending at the supermarket, reduce food waste, and to avoid ordering Uber Eats when you’re too tired or busy to cook.Ask for a payrise - Kiwi’s are notoriously bad about asking for more money but in the current market workers have more power than they’ve had in quite some time. Ensure you are compensated fairly for your role. Do your research and see how your salary compares to others in your industry. Hay’s NZ has a great salary guide, check it out here.Get into investing (if you’re not already!) and mix it up! - It might seem counterintuitive to invest when the market is dropping. But it’s actually a good time for anyone who’s not close to retirement to invest their money. Diversifying across several different types of assets to help withstand a volatile stock market period is recommended at the moment.Lastly, stay calm, don't make any drastic decisions and TALK TO US at Foxplan Our experience has taught us that unforeseen events happen, so stay diversified and don’t panic as we’re all on this inflation ride together.Our team of experienced advisers are here to help, so please reach out to us today and book a non-obligation money talk.",,"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 20:24:58 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
Is now a good time to invest in property?,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579469196914-0CN613YR175O6KBYP0ZA/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"It’s not the easiest time to be a Landlord right now. 484 Landlords are potentially in hot water over their failure to insulate their investment properties. New tax changes have also meant that losses from owning a rental can no longer be claimed against direct income and must be deferred forward.With this double whammy, it’s fair to ask whether the staple Kiwi rental property is still a good investment option.The Law ChangesOn July 1 this year legislation passed by the previous National government came into force which means all investment properties must have underfloor and overhead insulation - with the only exception being properties where the installation was not practical.Landlords have had a three year grace period for installation but the insulation industry is at maximum capacity with estimates of as many as 100,000 investment properties are yet to be insulated. Failure to insulate allows tenants to claim up to $4,000 directly from their landlord and thus far at least 44 disputes have been lodged with the tenancy tribunal.On the taxation side – previously if landlords had spent more on the cost of owning property than was earned in rent, the shortfall could be deducted against their personal taxable income. In the 2016/17 tax year, 116,000 landlords declared such a loss. Now, this loss can only be carried forward to be deducted against a profit made in the future.The ImplicationsBeing reliant solely on tax laws for an investment to stack up is not likely to provide long-term stability when investing. Rising rental prices in the Wellington region will protect many landlords from negative gearing changes but some will be caught out.Is now a good time to invest in property? The truth is it all depends on your personal circumstances. There is no magic yes or no answer that will always apply and every individual is different!We’ve talked before about other investment strategies ($10,000 invested in 1971 in NZ property would be worth $570,000 at the end of 2017 vs. $1.35m if invested in global shares) and believe now is a great time to have a discussion about your own investment options to see if they are working for you as best they can.If you would like to review your investment options with one of our advisers, please email info@foxplan.nz to arrange a meeting.

But what does this actually mean? The term ESG refers to the practice of considering environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria when making investment decisions. This means that in addition to financial returns, investors consider how a company's operations and policies impact the environment, society, and the way it is managed.Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) is an investment practice which is considered socially responsible due to the nature of the business the company conducts. This investment practice involves avoiding investments in companies that produce or sell addictive substances or activities (like alcohol, gambling, and tobacco) in favour of seeking out companies that are engaged in social justice, environmental sustainability, and alternative energy/clean technology efforts. The rising popularity of ESG and SRI investing is a testament to the fact that investors are no longer content with simply chasing financial returns. They are embracing investments that align with their values and contribute to the betterment of the planet and society, and with rising concerns around climate change, social justice and war crimes, investors are pushing companies and regulators to adopt and focus on the ESG and SRI issues. In New Zealand, sustainable investing is on a remarkable upward trajectory. This trend is reflected in the surge of interest in sustainable investment options as more investment providers worldwide integrate this practice into their investment process. A report by the Responsible Investment Association Australasia (RIAA), the largest certifier of responsible investing in Australia and New Zealand titled “New Zealand responsible funds surpass laggard funds”, highlighted that responsible investment funds have overtaken traditional funds for the first time in 2022, reaching a record $183 billion in 2022, while traditional funds dropped to $169 billion. This covers 52% of the total managed funds market in New Zealand, surpassing traditional funds for the first time. “It’s only a few years since responsible investment was seen as a niche market. But the landscape has now turned on its head – today, funds not actively engaged in responsible investment are not just lagging; they’re stranded at the starting line of a race that’s already in full swing”, said Dean Hegarty, Executive Manager at RIAA. There is growing acceptance that ESG factors impact long-term financial performance, and a combination of other factors such as new climate-related regimes and high-profile investment in renewable energy projects all contribute to driving up the demand for responsible and ethical investing. For investors, the message is clear: it's high time to factor ESG and SRI considerations into your investment planning. There's mounting evidence demonstrating a strong correlation between adept ESG risk management and corporate financial performance. This isn't just about feeling good; it's an empirical reality that savvy investors should not overlook. Source: Responsible Investment Association Australasia. (2023, October 10).

"Shares vs Term Deposits, What Should I Invest In?",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/12f29411-971b-414f-a379-6c36fc93b049/image-asset.jpg?format=original,"Term deposits have been making waves lately with their enticing interest rates, sparking conversations about whether locking in a quick 6% return might trump the historically higher gains of the share market. Today, let's embark on an exploration of this common dilemma, uncovering the nuances that should guide our investment decisions.Picture this: You're pondering your financial strategy, and the question arises – ""Why not go for term deposits this year, snagging a solid 6% return, and save the shares for later?"" It's a question many are asking as they compare the recent allure of term deposits against the fluctuating returns of the share market.The conversation typically centers around the immediate perks of term deposits, especially when it comes to long-term financial planning like retirement. Yet, it's vital to anchor this discussion in the fundamental purpose of any investment – what are your goals? Whether it's securing your retirement or achieving other milestones, knowing your WHY can illuminate the path to smarter investment choices. Sure, the advertised interest rates on term deposits might seem like a windfall, but let's not forget about the stealthy thief known as inflation. Over the years, term deposits have averaged around 4%, often falling short of keeping pace with inflation. The real challenge for investors lies in ensuring that their money's purchasing power remains intact over time. [caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""1175""] NZ Inflation rate from June 1990-September 2023 [/caption] With inflation currently at 4.7% and term deposits hovering around 6%, that's less than a 0.4% gain annually. Still tempted?A quick glance at short-term returns might sway you, but the real story unfolds over the long haul. While the share market might have a slow year or two, historical data reveals an average return of 9.69% over the last two decades, leaving term deposit returns in the dust.One common objection revolves around the perceived risk of diving into shares. The fear of potential losses often leads people to opt for the seemingly safer returns of term deposits. However, it's crucial to factor in tax implications and the actual return after taxes, particularly for those in higher tax brackets.In this intricate dance between term deposits and shares, success hinges on aligning investment choices with long-term financial objectives. While term deposits certainly have their place in financial planning, relying solely on them might mean missing out on the wealth-building opportunities offered by the share market. Ultimately, the decision rests on individual goals, risk appetite, and the ability to navigate the dynamic world of finance.",,"Thu, 11 Apr 2024 22:12:38 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
January 2022 - Quarterly investment update,,"We hope you had a relaxing time over the Christmas and New Year period and are looking forward to a happy and rewarding year ahead.Stay the course and focus on the long-termAs you may have seen or read, equity markets have started on the back foot for 2022. This is partly because inflation in many parts of the world remains at decade-highs, the geopolitical situation in Ukraine, and Central Banks raising interest rates. All of this means that some investors believe that equities could underperform.While it may be a little unnerving to see the value of your investments fluctuate, it’s important to take a step back and view the performance of equity markets over the long run.A key barometer for global equity markets is the S&P 500 in the US, and over the past three years, it has delivered annual returns of more than 15%, with two of the three years seeing gains of more than 25% (ANZ, 2022). So, while instinct might tell you to switch to a more conservative investment option, staying the course, having patience, and sticking to a plan might be the best strategy in unsettling times.It’s hard to predict when markets will change direction and trying to pick the best times to change funds comes with risk.As a summary of what happened last year, enclosed is the Synergy Summer Update covering the reporting period from October to December 2021. Although global economic growth was positive through the last quarter and looking relatively resilient, the environment remains replete with enough uncertainties (inflation, interest rates, Omicron) that investment returns are likely to remain volatile.An overview of the broad economic environment is contained in the market commentary section of the update. A more detailed summary of the various market returns through the quarter is covered in the key market movements section.The update concludes with a feature article titled ‘You can’t put a number on happiness’. Aiming to achieve a certain amount of money may well be a financial goal many of us have but, on its own, its unlikely to contribute strongly to our wellbeing. What contributes far more are the many different choices that money can enable us to pursue.The reports compiled in this newsletter have been prepared by Consilium.As always, we look forward to updating you with the progress of markets and investments throughout the year.

January 2023 - Quarterly Investment Update,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/61e93abf-88ff-4a80-a22e-375d40be0a9f/k.png?format=original,"Good afternoon,We hope you had an enjoyable time over the Christmas and New Year period and are looking forward to the rest of 2023 as much as we are.It is our pleasure to enclose our Summer Update covering the reporting period from October to December 2022.After a challenging year for investment markets, the final quarter delivered some welcome relief with share markets in particular performing strongly.Within the update, the lead market commentary article provides an overview of the quarter and highlights several themes, including the current fight to control inflation and the improving outlook for bonds.A more detailed summary of the various market returns through the quarter, and over longer time horizons, is covered in the key market movements section.The feature article by Consilium titled ‘Why is there no Lionel Messi of managed funds?’, references the recent soccer world cup, and examines why persistent outperformance in sports is unable to be replicated within funds management. It’s recommended reading for those that believe finding a “guru” fund manager is the pathway to investment success.

Investment Newsletter - June 2023,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/72a07939-2094-4d86-bbb3-36e86553c7dc/stockimg-2-4140291-9900000000079e3c.jpg?format=original,"Good afternoon,We are pleased to enclose our June Update for 2023. Consider your financial adviser as your personal trainer. Much like a personal trainer, a financial adviser possesses expertise and knowledge in their respective field. However, their value extends beyond their expertise. For most of us, the issue isn’t that exercise is too complicated but rather the motivation to exercise consistently to achieve the desired results. In other words, the value of a personal trainer probably has more to do with the discipline of consistent exercise, than with the technical nature of how to correctly perform the exercise. Ben Graham, the author of one of the most referenced books on investments titled: The Intelligent Investor, was quoted saying “an investor’s chief problem – and even his worst enemy – is likely to be himself”. This links to a 2011 paper titled “The Behaviour of Individual Investors”, where professors have found that the main obstacle to financial success often stems from behavioral and psychological factors. Their five conclusions were that, in general, individual investors, Underperform standard benchmarks (e.g. a low cost index fund)Sell winning investments while holding losing investments (the ‘disposition effect’) Are heavily influenced by limited attention and past return performance in their purchase decisions Engage in naïve reinforcement learning by repeating past behaviours that coincided with pleasure, while avoiding past behaviours that generated pain Tend to hold undiversified share portfolios The role of an adviser is to counteract the impact of these factors that have the potential to undermine sound and effective long-term investment decision making. To change behaviour, we assist you with defining what you really want your money to achieve for you in life. We must then substantially increase the probability that you are able to achieve those outcomes. The key is to help you make smarter investment decisions and prioritise what matters to you the most. The best advice is honest and sometimes confronting, but it is decisive and adaptable to changes in markets and lifestyle. It's not that investing is difficult, it’s just difficult for most individuals to do it consistently well. Like exercise, it’s not about making a big effort every once in a while. Great advice is best to be implemented consistently and carefully over a long period of time. Investors would do well to think of their financial adviser as their personal (financial) trainer. Not just because an adviser is more likely to help us make better long term investment decisions, but because he or she will keep us motivated and on track when we might otherwise succumb to poor behaviour.

Lets have a chat about Money,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579458018680-4909O8JNHA0L8YQDIEIM/Lets%2Bhave%2Ba%2Bchat%2Babout%2BMoney.jpg?format=original,"This week we have presented content from our Monthly Investment Newsletter.Kia Ora. Ko te herengi wiki.Last week was Money Week in New Zealand, an annual event designed to raise awareness of financial issues and literacy. This year it also coincided with Maori Language Week where people are encouraged to speak more Te Reo – to give it a try. Interestingly, the theme of Money Week this year was also about communication and encouraging New Zealanders to talk about money with their taupuhi (loved ones), whanau (family) and tamariki (children).Many of you reading this will be planning clients, so have already experienced the benefits that come from openly discussing money with your partner or a trusted friend. You will know how being open and honest about your finances makes it far easier to make smart decisions that result in both a sense of, and the reality of, ‘financial well-being’.But it is far from easy for most New Zealanders to openly discuss money with others. Particularly so if you are better off than many others, or instead, if you are embarrassed about your financial circumstances. If you are the former, whilst our society happily puts successful sports people on a pedestal, it rarely wants to praise or celebrate those who have had great financial success.This double standard is part of the reason so many just stay quiet about money. But, how much better might it be if those who have found financial success were encouraged and celebrated when they shared their ideas, successes and failures? How wonderful it would be to see children not only practicing sporting moves that emulate their rugby, netball or sailing idols but also regularly being involved in, or talking about, financial ventures with their peers or parents?So, today, tomorrow or on the weekend, as well as finding time to be indoors or outdoors practicing or participating in sport with your tamariki or mokopuna (grandchildren), start to build a habit of talking about and showing them about money.As always, if you would like to talk with us about money - please don't hesitate to get in touch with us at info@foxplan.nz.

From contents to car, life to income protection, funeral cover to pet insurance and everything between. Being aware of what insurance covers exist let alone understanding what they do is a challenge.An often overlooked, but potentially life changing insurance cover is Trauma. This week we dive in to explain it.What is Trauma InsuranceIf you live in New Zealand, you have a one in three chance that you will suffer a ‘Trauma’ event in your lifetime. A trauma event is a critical illness such as a heart attack, stroke or cancer.These types of illnesses are particularly cruel as they do not just rob us of our health, but often our loved ones are also deeply impacted as they drop everything to be the support network. Organising everything from the cooking, to being the transport for medical appointments as well as acting as a source of comfort.Overnight two incomes can be reduced to one or none this is where Trauma Insurance steps in by providing a lump-sum cash payout (tax-free).The benefits of Trauma InsuranceTrauma Insurance removes the immediate financial stress associated with a critical illness.Trauma Insurance usually provides automatic cover for children (and/or grandchildren) and the funds from the payout can be used for anything you desire including income support, childcare and/or holidays. Critically, these funds can also be used to fund alternative medical treatment options.Things to be aware ofThere are a wide range of Trauma Insurance products available within the New Zealand market - with insurers offering varying definitions and coverage levels. Some insurers cover all types of cancer, but many only cover specified types. Some products will offer a payout based on the severity of the conditions and others pay out a guaranteed figure.The key to getting your Trauma cover right is to work with a financial adviser who can present you with all the options and ensure your coverage is right for your own personal circumstances.The costsAs a standalone cover, Trauma Insurance can usually be purchased for less than $50 per month on a $100,000 benefit for those aged 40 or under. Costs can be reduced further by bundling a trauma benefit with Life Insurance coverage.If you would like to have a conversation about Trauma Insurance, please email info@foxplan.nz to arrange a meeting with one of our financial advisers.The views and opinions expressed in this newsletter are not intended to be a personalised service for an individual retail client.

How to Build Wealth AND Enjoy Life - Part 3,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/837f27a6-c46b-4e15-afe0-d033930138cf/Untitled+design+%2845%29.png?format=original,"Welcome back to the final installment of our three-part series on building wealth while enjoying life. In this edition, we delve into the intriguing realm of credit card rewards, where the allure of ""free"" can either propel you forward or lead to unexpected pitfalls.The Allure and Perils of “Free”Lately, there has been quite the buzz about folks using credit cards with reward structures to build up points. They play the game of using the credit card for expenses, paying off the balance each month, and reaping the benefits in the form of air points or bonuses. But is this strategy a smart move, or does it come with hidden dangers?Let's dive into it. The idea of getting something for ""free"" is tempting, but we all know, if it's free, you're probably the product. Over the past 50 years, paying for things has become ridiculously easy. From physically going to the bank to waving our phones or watches, or just clicking buttons online, the ease of payment is by design. But who designed it? Certainly not someone aiming to help you save more money.So…The question arises – should you take advantage of credit card bonuses if you can pay off the balance monthly? Well, it depends on your money personality. If you're disciplined with your money, then sure, go for it. But don't fall into the traps. Have a separate reserve fund for emergencies, pay off the balance promptly, and be mindful of the impact on your credit score. Your credit card limit can also affect your financial profile, even if your balance is at zero. When applying for a mortgage, banks might assume you've maxed out that limit, impacting how much you can borrow. It's a sneaky detail that can have a significant impact.If you know your money personality, and you have good control over your money, credit card bonuses might be a worthwhile experience. But, it's not a one-size-fits-all scenario. Your approach should align with your money personality. That wraps up our exploration of credit card rewards. Stay tuned for our final blog, where we'll reveal the #1 game-changer for building wealth while enjoying life.",,"Fri, 09 Feb 2024 01:55:09 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
Mad Money / Sane Money,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1614829437319-AVZH0I03E6A3WEGPYDRU/WW.png?format=original,"Let's talk about your dream - whatever it may be. Perhaps you'd like to buy a sports car, or travel the world, or retire on a remote plot of land and raise some chickens, or perhaps all that and more. As an investor, this dream is perhaps the most important aspect of your investment strategy - and achieving it needs to be your reason for investing. Ultimately, a good investor is simply one who achieves their dream.Now let's pretend that your dream is going to cost a million dollars, and a good Samaritan comes along and gives you two offers. The first is simple, he'll give you a million dollars and be on his way - enough for you to turn your dream into a reality. Alternatively, you can flip a coin - tails, you walk away with nothing; heads, you walk away with two million dollars - enough for you to turn your dream into a reality, and much more.It's not a very difficult choice to make; why risk it all in pursuit of more than you need?As an investor, you've got an incredibly large range of options available to you - whether it's buying cryptocurrencies, trading options, or investing in a managed portfolio. Essentially, you can risk what you like chasing returns, but when wanting a certain and predictable outcome, do you want to be mad (speculating), or sane (using a big boring portfolio)?To reaffirm this argument of taking the academically backed option (big passive portfolios) over actively managed funds, we can look to the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting for shareholders which happened at the start of this month. In typical fashion, Warren Buffett (Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway) and Charlie Munger (Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway) spent several hours answering questions and ultimately discussing everything about investing. Early into the meeting, Buffett singled out newer investors and highlighted some of the difficulties in picking stocks.Illustrating this, Buffett showed a list of the 20 largest companies in the world by stock market value (on 31 March 2021) and compared it to the same list 30 years ago. Notably, the lists were unique - none of the largest companies three decades ago were the same ones there today. One of the biggest changes was the increase in technology companies, but even this has a lesson in itself. Buffett goes on to explain how back at the start of the 1900s, when the automotive industry was beginning to kick-off, over 2000 automotive companies were launched. By 2009 however, only three were left. This goes to suggest that even if you can pick the right industry to invest in, you also need to know which companies within that industry will make it.To conclude, this goals-based approach to investing cannot be stressed enough. We believe in helping you achieve your dreams and urge you to look at your investment portfolio through the same lens.

The bank stated that in order to cater for those withdrawals, it had to sell part of its bond holdings at a steep loss of $1.8 billion at the same time the US Federal Reserve [1] raised interest rates.Investors at both banks have got worried about their viability and proceeded to withdraw even more money from the banks — a textbook definition of a ""bank run"".What do these failures mean for NZ investors?Analysts have suggested that despite initial panic on Wall Street, these collapses are unlikely to set off the kind of domino effect that gripped the banking industry during the Global Financial Crisis.In order to restore confidence in America’s banking system, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg released a joint statement on Sunday US time. They announced FDIC will make Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank’s customers whole by guaranteeing all deposits including all uninsured deposits.“The system is as well-capitalized and liquid as it has ever been,” Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi said. “The banks that are now in trouble are much too small to be a meaningful threat to the broader system.” (CNN, 2023)No Need to Hit the Panic ButtonWhilst we cannot know if other banks in the US are at risk, the US Government has sent a signal to US deposit holders that withdrawing money in response to fear is unnecessary.For our clients, the direct exposure to these banks in our share portfolios is minimal, between 0.03% and 0.04% depending on the underlying fund. That translates into about 3 - 4 cents for every $100 invested. These small exposures show the benefit of wide diversification across many businesses and industries.As you are reading this, markets have already priced in this news and the actions of the US government seem to have gone a long way towards calming markets. As always, we encourage investors to look past periods of short-term volatility, which in the long run are unlikely to impact your plan.If this has sparked any questions you would like us to address, we are only a phone call or an email away.

Mortgage repayment options,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579610371087-I3XBY1EQ02EZ0NUGT5S4/Mortgage+repayment+options.jpg?format=original,"A mortgage is essentially an obligation to repay a debt, with the property purchased being the collateral or security on which the loan is obtained. Mortgages are either interest-only, principal and interest, with either fixed or variable interest rate options Floating versus Fixed Your mortgage interest rate may be fixed, floating, or a combination of both. The floating rate is based on the OCR (official cash rate) set by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Fixed rates are funded by overseas banks (predominantely the US). In New Zealand 5 years is typically the longest you can fix a mortgage for. FoxPlan Tip Ask your FoxPlan/New Zealand Home Loan (NZHL) adviser about strategies for repaying your Mortgage faster by using interest and term strategies. Paying Off your Mortgage (Principal & Interest) Whenever you make payments on your mortgage a portion of it goes on to:a. Paying the bank first i.e. their interest, andb. Whats left over pays off the debt i.e. your principal.After paying off the interest first, often there is not much left over, and this is why it takes quite some time for the debt to go down.So the faster you can reduce your principal the more you will save. The standard term for a Mortgage is 30 years, but can be lower. FoxPlan Tip If you accumulate lump sums of capital it is a good idea to put the majority of it onto your Mortgage. The drop in principal will save you interest, which could add up to a lot of money over the life of the loan. Interest Only Mortgage You pay the bank their interest only, no debt (i.e. principal) is repaid.Circumstances may dictate an interest only mortgage as being the most appropriate short, medium or long term option. Residential property investors often grow a portfolio of properties based on the non repayment of capital. In other circumstances cash flow may determine your Financial Adviser making a recommendation to have a period of interest only on a mortgage for home owners or home renovators. Lenders need to approve Interest Only and only approve for short duration. In cases when the LVR exceeds 80% it is unlikely the bank will offer an Interest Only option.

When can I quit my job / retire?,,"Just wondering, when can I quit my job / retire? Lots of people are actively wondering how they can escape the 9-5. Escape the corporate lifestyle. We are here to tell you that the age at which you retire is ultimately your decision. It all comes down to discipline. The earlier you plan your retirement the earlier you can make it a reality. What is retirement? Retirement is simply replacing your income so you no longer need to trade your time for money. There are many ways to create additional income sources so we will leave that up to you, but ultimately we eventually want to replace our income completely or accumulate enough wealth in a lump sum that we no longer need to work again. There are multiple government schemes that will help supplement income once you reach retirement age and so, you’ll just need to contribute enough to your retirement fund to match the lifestyle you expect to live. The more indulgent the lifestyle the more income we will need. As Dean mentions in his video, when you’re retired every day is the weekend and we all know that we spend more on a Saturday & Sunday than we do on a weekday. With this in mind let’s follow the two steps below to firstly determine the income needed for our fun years. We also need to determine when it is we’d like to retire. Is it at age 65 or can we afford to bring this forward? Can we simply start winding back work to part time for a few years before the big day. Secondly when we are in retirement we need to measure and monitor our spending. If we have our money invested, it’s about monitoring the market and making sure our investment plan is on track. Alternatively if we have a big wad of cash in the bank we need to make sure we’re monitoring our purchasing power as everyday basic needs become more and more expensive over the years. Let’s get started below. 1. Set a targetWhen do you want to retire? How long until you will retire? How many more years do you have to accumulate wealth?How much do you need to live on in retirement? What’s your expected annual income per year? How long do you plan on being retired? 30 years? 2. Track our progress Now that we understand the goal (when we are going and when we need to be there) we can start to measure the progress. Let’s reverse engineer it. If we need to accumulate $100,000 over 10 years it’s pretty simple to work out how much we need to save each year to make that happen. If the savings are looking unrealistic and we need to leverage our money to create an additional income source - now is the time investigate further. Do you need an investment plan to help you get to your goal faster? Are you willing to take on some risk in order to make your goal become a reality? If this is the case and you’d like some investment advice feel free to get in touch. Signing out for Money Week We hope you’ve enjoyed watching our videos as part of Sorted’s Money Week this year.

Investment Newsletter - November 2022,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/4f3778a8-817e-451a-ade3-d3845229ef5a/f.jpg?format=original,"November NewsletterGood afternoon,Newton’s Third Law of Motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.This quote is very well-known within the scientific community. In finance, there have been historical events where we can also observe this phenomenon. For example, when we see the value of an asset increasing, we can observe that the value of another asset decreases, although not necessarily with an equal magnitude.For the past two decades, we have seen traditional investments such as equities and bonds were negatively correlated. This means that when the price of equities increases, the price of bonds decreases, and vice versa. Because of this, fund managers will tend to allocate a portion of their portfolios to bonds to reduce risk and manage volatility. However, 2022 shows us otherwise. Equities and Bonds have both decreased (Positive Correlation).It is worth noting that 2022 is not a unique case. There have been instances in the past that it is positively corelated or have positive correlation. Fund managers throughout the decades have become more and more creative, branching out with the investment instruments they use, on top of the traditional investments - these are called alternative investments. Alternative investments can include cryptocurrency, commodities, and derivatives.With the equity and bond markets both being down, would alternative investments, be a better way to reduce risk?In this newsletter, we could look at cryptocurrency, commodities, and derivatives but it would be a very long, winded newsletter! Instead, we will just look at cryptocurrency.In simple terms, cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual currency. It can serve as ordinary money, but it has no physical counterparts, such as banknotes or coins that can be carried around. Cryptocurrency exists only in electronic form.“Everything you don’t understand about money combined with everything you don’t understand about computers.”—HBO’s Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, March 11, 2018Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin have been given great attention due to its meteoric rise in value in recent years. Given its dramatic price changes, it is not surprising that investors are looking into the role of cryptocurrencies in a portfolio.Price of Bitcoin, January 2015 – November 2022 Source: Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD) Price History & Historical Data - Yahoo FinanceIn assessing the merits of allocating cryptocurrency into a portfolio to reduce risk, let’s first look at the factors in determining the components of a portfolio. The two most common factors are that the assets should achieve a positive expected return over time, and the assets should help mitigate uncertainty.Let’s look at the expected return criterion of the most widely recognized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. It is unclear of whether investing in Bitcoin has a positive expected return. This is because it offers no claim on future profits of a company, as one gets with equities, and receives no interest payments, as one is entitled to with a bond. Bitcoin’s returns are derived from holding and depending on it appreciating in value against the dollar, which is a speculative investment.It is also unclear how Bitcoin can help investors manage risk given that this asset has historically fallen in value by double-digit percentages in a single day. Therefore, the extreme fluctuation of Bitcoin is not a suitable asset to hold to reduce risk. Because of this, we do not believe that allocating capital to cryptocurrency reduces portfolio risk.If you wish to further discuss about alternative investments or any other topics with us, please let us know and we can arrange accordingly. Withdrawals pre-ChristmasWith the Christmas break quickly approaching, we know that this is a time when extra funds may be required. In early December is when we conduct a rebalance of portfolios to account for withdrawals for the holiday period. This year, we will process this on Monday, the 5th of December. If you require any one-off withdrawals or require additional funds before Christmas Eve, please let your adviser know, or reply to this email before Thursday, the 1st of December so we can account for this when rebalancing.The funds will be paid out within 10 business days.Please note that regular withdrawals that has been set prior to this are unaffected. You can expect your regular withdrawals to occur automatically, on the date you have specified (or the business day after).As always if you require the funds to be withdrawn after this period, we can still arrange for this to be done. Please contact us at advisersupport@foxplan.nz or info@foxplan.nz and we will assist you.FoxPlan’s offices will be closed from the afternoon of the 21st of December 2022 and will re-open on the 9th of January 2023.

Global equities were mostly lower over the third quarter as rising bond yields and the likelihood that interest rates would stay higher for longer weighed on most growth assets.Within the update, the lead market commentary article provides an overview of the quarter and highlights several drivers of the recent returns, with a snapshot of weakened key commodity prices, decline in house prices and stabilised interest rates, while reinforcing the value of diversification.A more detailed summary of the various market returns through the quarter and over longer time horizons is covered in the key market movements section.The feature article by Consilium titled ‘Lessons for investors in an AI future” takes a look at how the share market responds to technological innovations, proving that the emergence of AI can be a volatile but also a potentially rewarding experience. And finally emphasises the importance of disciplined investment principles, diversification, and patience for long-term success in this ever-evolving landscape. Looking ahead, inflation remains at the forefront of policymakers decisions both in New Zealand and overseas. Central banks are cautious about further rate hikes, with New Zealand's central bank likely to follow the global trend unless we see a sharp rise in unemployment, and the overall economic outlook suggests slowing growth with the potential for a mild recession if tight monetary policy persists.We look forward to keeping you informed on the performance of markets and investments throughout the coming months.We are only a phone call or an email away should you wish to discuss anything.

How to Build Wealth AND Enjoy Life - Part 2,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/32f7f919-c469-4ed9-baa3-37b312015ce0/Untitled+design+%2844%29.png?format=original,"Ready to delve further into how to build wealth while enjoying your life? In this blog, we highlight the drawbacks of relying on a single savings account for various financial goals, stressing the need to create separate accounts to ensure clarity and prevent unintended setbacks. Additionally, we explore the significance of understanding one's money personality and fostering a clear vision to navigate the financial journey with purpose. Join us as we uncover essential strategies for financial success. The Importance of Goal-Oriented Accounts in Financial PlanningWhen it comes to managing money, many people fall into the trap of having a single savings account for all their financial goals. Having one savings account might seem convenient initially, but it often leads to unintended consequences. Imagine having $50,000 in a single account earmarked for various goals like a holiday, a car upgrade, or children's education. When faced with a choice, such as purchasing a $20,000 car or a $50,000 car, the decision-making becomes challenging. Similarly, overspending on one goal, like a holiday, may jeopardise other goals. The key to achieving financial goals lies in creating separate accounts for each objective. This ensures a clear understanding of the cost, timeframe, and priority of each goal. Without this clarity, you may find yourself getting back from the car dealership or holiday destination with a whole lot less money than you need for your other goals - but it’s fine, you can just borrow some money or put it on the credit card… Right? No. Before you create your separate goal accounts, it is vital to work out what your goals are, what they are going to cost, and when you want to have them. If you don't have clarity around that, you will stumble along without purpose and it will be hard to achieve anything. Getting Past Your Money PersonalityUnderstanding your money personality is the key to success with this because changing your approach to money isn't as simple as saying, ""Just do it."" We often grapple with our ingrained money personalities. If the thought of spending money makes your stomach turn or you can’t imagine sticking to a budget because you are a reckless spender, mere encouragement won't suffice.It's about having a vision, a clear understanding of what you want, and visualising the impact. This clarity acts as a guiding force, keeping you on the right path. To compare it to something outside of money, if you were going on holiday and you wanted to lose some weight before the trip and you can picture yourself on that beach by a certain date, at a certain weight, there is a much higher chance of actually working towards that. A clear vision makes for a smooth financial journey. In the next blog, we are stepping into the world of credit card rewards – where ""free"" isn't always what it seems. Keep an eye out.",,"Thu, 01 Feb 2024 21:03:24 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz

Pause and Save,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1691970425584-WXJGRB0CHHGLV8168GQD/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily life. Amidst the constant juggling of work, family, and social commitments, one essential aspect often takes a back seat – our finances. ""Pause and Save"" encourages us to halt our routine, take a step back, and evaluate our financial standing. Taking a moment to pause, reflect, and reassess our finances can have a massive impact on our long-term savings goals and overall financial success.The Power of ReflectionTaking a moment to reflect on our spending habits and financial choices can be enlightening. It allows us to identify unnecessary expenses, recognise patterns of overspending, and acknowledge areas that have room for improvement. Reflection is the first step towards understanding our financial situation and making smarter financial decisions. Assessing Your Financial HealthBefore setting savings goals, it's crucial to assess your current situation. Calculate your net worth, track your income and expenses, and analyse your debt-to-income ratio (compare how much you owe each month to how much you earn). This assessment provides a clear snapshot of where you stand and serves as a foundation for building your financial future.Setting Savings GoalsSaving money becomes more meaningful when you have clear goals in mind. Whether it's buying a home, funding your child's education, or retiring comfortably, defining specific goals gives your savings purpose and direction. Goals act as a motivator and guide, making it easier to stay on track. Creating a Realistic BudgetA well-structured budget is an integral part of effective financial planning. It allocates your income to various categories, ensuring you have enough for wants and needs, while leaving room for savings and investments. A budget curbs impulsive spending and promotes smarter financial decisions. Embracing Frugality with PurposeFrugality doesn't mean deprivation; it means being resourceful and intentional with your spending. Differentiate between needs and wants, and seek cost-effective alternatives without sacrificing quality. By embracing frugality with purpose, you free up funds for saving and investing.Investing Wisely for the FutureSaving alone might not be sufficient to achieve long-term financial goals. Investing allows your money to grow over time. Research and consider investment options, like managed funds or property, aligning them with your risk tolerance and financial objectives. KiwiSaver also offers a range of fund options tailored to different risk appetites. Take a moment to find out who your KiwiSaver is with, what fund you’re in, if your fund suits your goals and timeline, and if your investment aligns with your values. The Role of Emergency FundsLife is unpredictable, and unexpected expenses can derail your financial progress. An emergency fund acts as a safety net, providing financial security during challenging times. Aim for three to six months' worth of living expenses in your emergency fund.Staying Disciplined and ConsistentConsistency is key to successful financial management. Set up automated transfers to your savings and investment accounts, ensuring that you consistently contribute towards your goals. Discipline prevents the temptation to deviate from your financial plan.Cultivating Long-Term Financial HabitsSustainable financial success is built on consistent habits. Cultivate practices such as reviewing your finances regularly, staying educated about personal finance, and seeking professional advice when needed. These habits ensure your financial journey remains on track.Secure Your Financial FutureIn a world characterised by rapid change, taking a moment to pause and save is more crucial than ever. By assessing your financial situation, setting clear goals, embracing frugality, and making informed investment choices, you can pave the way for a secure and prosperous financial future. Frequently Asked QuestionsWhy is reflecting on my finances important? Reflecting on your finances helps you identify spending patterns, cut unnecessary expenses, and make smarter financial decisions to improve your future.How do I start investing if I'm new to it? Begin by researching different investment options and their associated risks. Consider consulting a financial adviser to create an investment strategy aligned with your goals.What's the significance of an emergency fund? What if your car breaks down? What if you lose your job? An emergency fund provides a financial cushion during unexpected situations, preventing the need to rely on high-interest loans or credit cards.Can I enjoy life while being frugal? Absolutely! Frugality doesn't mean sacrificing enjoyment. It means making conscious choices to spend on what truly matters to you.When should I start saving and investing? The best time to start is now. The earlier you begin, the more time your money has to grow through compounding interest.",,"Sun, 13 Aug 2023 23:53:00 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz

It’s safe to say that when a global health crisis triggers a global market meltdown, its unlikely to be smooth sailing. But the second quarter was extraordinary for entirely different reasons. What emerged from the rubble of the market low on 23 March, was a second quarter rebound that surprised and confounded even the most ardent bulls. The second article takes readers back to 1998. Not to reminisce about popular girl band the Spice Girls, but to provide a parable of sorts about a sound investment strategy. It’s a timely reminder that building an investment strategy based on data and evidence, can’t win every single year, but it does tilt the odds in your favour of achieving long term investment success.Whilst the markets have recovered significant ground over the last three months, the catalyst that undermined them in the first place (Covid-19) remains untamed around the globe. Given that, it continues to be a risk factor that could yet have more influence over markets in the weeks and months ahead. However, for the time being at least, markets are looking past this uncertainty towards the prospect of better times ahead. As we move into the second half of this very unusual year, we look forward to continuing to update you with the progress of investment markets.Annual rebalancing of your portfolio.Every year in August, we rebalance your portfolio to ensure the value of funds held in shares & property (growth assets) and bonds & cash (income assets) remains appropriate for your plan.If you have additional money to invest this is the lowest cost time of the year to do so. Alternately, if you think you will need to make a lumpsum withdrawal from your portfolio in the next 6 months, now is lowest cost time to do so. If either of those is the case, please let us know as soon as possible by email to info@foxplan.nz or phone 0800 NO STRESS (0800 667 873) or contact your Adviser.Kind regards,The FoxPlan TeamYou can find more important information about us here.

"Shipwrecks, leadership &amp; creating your future(rather than waiting for it)",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1588604093863-QLS3JD9MRGSFPMYNN0YS/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"Hello all,Following on from the fantastic response we had from you, when we sent you Jamie Fitzgerald’s thought provoking newsletter about 'Your Response to Covid 19', Jamie has sent us another such newsletter, this time about Leadership and creating your future. Again, this is kindly republished with Jamie’s consent. We hope you enjoy this as much as we have. I was blown away with the generous feedback after my last newsletter about rowing through the storm. I was asked to share more stories relevant to us all, and this one today is unforgettable. As we head toward the weekend (and an Easter 'stay-cation' for New Zealand), I've offered 4(+1) lessons I encourage you to reflect on. In our documentary series Intrepid New Zealand I learnt about and recreated parts of two tragic, yet inspiring, shipwrecks that occurred in New Zealand’s waters. The lessons from these two ships (the Grafton & Invercauld) are so relevant to people, business and leadership right now it’s creepy.The two ships sink at opposite ends of the same deserted island in a true story of human nature and leadership at its best—and its worst.It isn’t clear how long the aftermath of Covid-19 will continue, but in many ways people, organisations and economies have been shipwrecked just like these two ships back in 1864. OK, let’s go... The sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands are a sanctuary for many species of plants and animals and are culturally and spiritually significant to Ngāi Tahu. Situated 465km south of New Zealand, the climate is wet, cold and windy, with a temperature averaging around 7 degrees. Their isolation makes them a treasure today for conservationists, but 140 years ago they were often a death warrant for seamen. If ships got too close, the sub-Antarctic winds would crumple them against shallow reefs and the islands’ tall cliffs. The lucky sailors drowned instantly. Most of the rest died slowly of exposure or starvation. A few survived to share the story. Once shipwrecked your world is turned upside down, your senses are overwhelmed, despair can be contagious, and your previous objectives while on board suddenly become irrelevant. Sound familiar?On the Grafton were five men led by Capt. Thomas Musgrave of Britain; a French gold miner named François Raynal; a leprosy-deformed Portuguese cook; a stoic Norwegian and a young Englishman — banded together in a common quest for survival. Eight days after the crew abandoned their boat in a ferocious storm at the southern end of the islands, the sun finally came out and the men emerged from a ripped sailcloth tent, Bible in hand. Raynal accounted after the ordeal that when the captain read out Christ’s exhortation to his disciples to love one another, all the listeners “Burst into tears”. New Zealand’s inspirational leader and Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, explained the country’s Covid-19 situation beautifully-clear and galvanised the nation around the principles we must ‘stand for’ and our response goals: “Stay home. Save lives”. Lesson 1:Simple messages, repeated frequently.Musgrave and the others salvaged whatever they could from their ship and built a very small cabin. They cooperated in procuring food and over the next 20 months they would pray, play chess and take parrots as pets. The men nursed one another and even held a democratic election, voting the captain their leader. What remains of the Grafton after it sank in 1864 Only four months after the Grafton sinks, and 20 miles northwest, a Scottish square-rigger named the Invercauld strikes a reef and sinks. Of the 25 crew, only 19 make it to shore. The captain, George Dalgarno, appears to fall into despair and madness immediately while the rest spend the next few days desperately searching for food on the rocky shoreline, locked in by a 300 foot cliff. The crew resort to anarchy, rage and cannibalism. If the southern part of Auckland Island is all “Robinson Crusoe”, the northern part is more “Lord of the Flies.” The only man with a grip on the situation is a low-ranking sailor named Robert Holding, despite some of the others threatening to eat him. For my IntrepidNZ co-host mate Kevin Biggar and I, explaining and recreating some of their hardship was bloody tough. Like their climb from sea level up to the plateau of the island, I’d prefer not to experience the challenges of that coastline again. The Invercauld had sunk in heavy seas and at a depth that made salvage impossible. Tough start! The crew found themselves on a desolate windy island. After just three months, only three remained. Time seemed to stop and they had no idea how long their struggle would continue. Again, very similar to what many are going through right now. Lesson 2:‘Strategy’ is about two things:1) How you’ll organise yourself to achieve an agreed objective; and,2) Deliberate choices Back at the Grafton brotherhood camp, they knew they needed a plan. The uncertainty of their future was immense, but they chose to take control. It was clear a rescue ship (as agreed in their planning back in Australia) would not arrive so they agreed the new goal and deliberately choose their future. To build a boat. In Musgrave’s words, “If men abandon us, let us save ourselves.”Incredibly, they improvised a grindstone to sharpen their hatchet and other tools, manufactured soap and tanned seal hides for new shoes. If that wasn’t enough, they constructed a forge and made more tools and nails from scrap metal. Through discipline and their extraordinary ability to problem-solve, a small boat was built for an ocean crossing. For Covid-19, stabilising the present, whilst proactively looking ahead is the only sustainable option. Recovery must start on Day 1. The boat sat a lot lower in the water than we were hoping. Kevin kindly suggested I could have benefited from a bit more starvation. Lesson 3 (from Abraham Lincoln):‘The best way to predict the future is to create it!’As for the Invercauld, (and Kevin and I in the show) things weren’t going so well. As the weeks went on, the survivors realised they weren’t very good at finding food. The savagery and lack of leadership continued. Two men, Fritz Hansen and William Horrey, got into a fist fight. Fritz hit the ground face first and was found dead the next morning. Several days later, Holding found Horrey eating Fritz. Note: In our shows we take on the challenge of wearing the same clothing, using the same equipment and eating the same food. It was a little tough to stick to all three of these rules on this episode! The three remaining survivors searched aimlessly for food, then built a small ‘canoe’ in the hope for finding food on a smaller island a few hundred meters away. No one trusted its design so Holding stepped-up ahead of his superior. More than a century on, Kevin and I couldn’t get too far in our little boat either.Finally, a passing ship headed for Peru spotted the three desperate men on the coast and picked them up. They’d been marooned for 12 months and 10 days. As they were welcomed aboard, Captain Dalgarno and Officer Smith were received into the captain’s cabin. Holding, however, was once again just an ordinary seaman and was given room in the deck house with the other lower ranks. Three men survived to tell the tale, but 22 others never made it home.For over 120 years, only Delgarno and Smith’s version of the tale was in print. Only in the mid 1980s was Holding’s unpublished manuscript discovered and the true story of the Invercauld finally revealed. Lesson 4:Hope on its own can be a choice, but it’s not a strategy.By comparison, what happens when everyone is clear on their shared strengths, roles and goals? Like Shackleton’s Antarctic adventure, it was agreed that for the benefit of the entire crew, some would have to stay behind. Eighteen months after being shipwrecked, Musgrave, Raynal and the Norwegian Alick McLaren set sail for New Zealand, 460km away.The huge navigational challenge was only matched by the size of the waves and storm that met them mid-ocean. The Captain said “The surface of the sea was covered with enormous billows, they raised us upon their huge backs to sink us under immediately and plunge us into the depths of the shifting abyss”. Miraculously they made it to New Zealand after a heroic few days at sea. Musgrave organised a ship and went back to the island himself, as promised, and collected his crewmates. Musgrave was haunted by the thought that there could be other castaways still on the island and so returned a second time on a navy ship to thoroughly search the island.It was here that he came upon the grisly remains of the crew of the Invercauld. Unknown to anyone at that point was that those last three survivors of a crew of twenty five had only just been rescued by a ship bound for Peru.When the Invercauld story was revealed the uproar caused the New Zealand government to set up a cast away depot on both the Campbell and the Auckland Islands. Stocked with supplies it would ensure that anyone marooned would be provided for should they have the misfortune to be wrecked on such a desolate shore.Intrepid NZ produced by Warner Bros International Television Production NZ;Photographs by Murray Milne (Muz!) What a story! Plenty of lessons, too. Here are Jamie's final thoughts.Strategy requires a clear goal and making deliberate choices between alternatives; Leadership is about inspiring others toward that shared goal; If you don’t know what you stand for, you’ll fall for anything; and, …If you’re either shipwrecked or worried about Covid-19, remember (and lesson #5):Stabilise the present, but be the creator of your future.

Socially Responsible Investing,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1618342050892-U23SOZVO8L4G4SI7FGPK/04-21_FXP_GrowMoneySavePlanet_01.1.png?format=original,"IntroductionSocially Responsible Investing (SRI) is the focus of this month's newsletter. We'll be addressing what it is, why it may be of interest to you, key considerations for SRI funds, and provide real examples of SRI fund options accessible to you (assuming you're based in New Zealand).As a side note, with the '20/21 financial year coming to an end, you may be curious about accessing your Consilium/Synergy consolidated tax report - please see the bottom of this email for further information on this, as well as information about upcoming changes to both the RWT Rate and the Consilium SRI fund.Why SRISRI funds provide an ideal opportunity for mutual benefit - the ability to grow your personal wealth through investments whilst also benefiting wider communities by placing greater emphasis and value on the greater good. By extension, this is also an opportunity to align your investments with your personal values and principles - if you don't like the idea of investing in nuclear warheads, GMO's, alcohol, or tobacco, you can choose not to.Historically SRI funds have been somewhat dismissed due to their expected lower returns; this is no longer the case. With additional resources going towards SRI funds in recent times, there are now numerous great SRI options for individuals that don’t require a clear compromise on expected return. This means that you as an investor can make a positive difference towards key current issues such as climate change, global violence, and equality, without forgoing the success of your plan or goals.What is SRISRI funds come in multiple forms - there's no clear set of guidelines as to what constitutes a ""Socially Responsible"" investment, however, there are typically two main approaches:The first and more common approach is using a 'negative screen', in which fund managers choose to cut out specific companies from their portfolio's should they be deemed 'bad'. This will often include specific industries such as military weaponry, fossil fuels, and adult entertainment. The alternative approach is that of a 'positive screen', where fund managers will choose to only invest in companies which they deem 'good'. This could be based on whether companies support fair-trade agreements, focus on environmentally sustainable practices, or do volunteer work in the community, to give a few examples. In practice, often a mixture of the two approaches will be applied – both getting rid of the ‘bad’ companies and giving additional weighting to the ‘good’ companies. Whilst all forms of Socially Responsible Investments will have a degree of subjectivity to them, they'll ultimately be geared towards making the world a better place.Key ConsiderationsIf you’re interested in SRI funds, there are a few things that you should consider prior:Does the fund align with your personal values and principles?Does the fund still have a respectable investment strategy?Will you still be able to achieve your plan and/or goals with an SRI fund?New Zealand SRI Fund OptionsConsilium/Synergy provide a full range of SRI fund options – passively managed like the standard Consilium Portfolios (see an example link below).“At a minimum, underlying investments will exclude companies involved in the production, manufacturing or significant sales of tobacco, controversial weapons, nuclear weapons or components developed or significantly modified for exclusive use in nuclear weapons, or auxiliary services related to nuclear weapons. In addition to these exclusions, SRI portfolios also have a significantly reduced exposure to greenhouse gas emissions and potential emissions from fossil fuel reserves, and an increased exposure to companies demonstrating sustainable business practices.”Booster has a range of KiwiSaver SRI fund options – enabling you to put your regular contributions somewhere good.“We use a combination of company reports, in-depth analysis and environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors to help us assess investment opportunities…An SRI investment fund is different because it actively excludes investments in socially controversial industries or businesses with damaging activities. Booster applies nine screening filters across our SRI funds, including weapons, fossil fuels and nuclear power production.”There is a full range of SRI fund options available to investors in New Zealand. The above examples are of investment products that FoxPlan can provide to our clients.ConclusionIf you are interested in socially responsible investing or would like to learn more about it – reach out to us today.

You know the type, the ones you purchase with dreams of sweating off the kilo’s and getting into top shape. It was delivered one day in a big cardboard box. I unwrapped it, marvelled at it, sat on it, and spun the wheels… and then mostly treated it like a piece of artwork. It was there to be admired but not touched.I don’t know if anyone else has had a similar experience, but my fitness regime using an exercise machine cum artwork/clothes hanger, is in stark contrast to a good friend who regularly works with a personal trainer. Month by month, spin class by spin class, I saw him getting fitter and fitter.Of course, a personal trainer should know a tremendous amount regarding the human muscular skeletal system and exercise techniques. But I don’t think the trainer’s technical acumen was the reason they work together. I mean, I’m sure the technical skill was valuable, but, honestly, if we want to get into shape, we all know how to use an exercise machine, right? The problem most of us have isn’t that exercise is too complicated or the human body too difficult to understand. For most of us the issue is the motivation to exercise consistently in order to achieve the desired results.In other words, the value of the personal trainer probably has more to do with the discipline of consistent exercise, than with the technical nature of how to correctly perform the exercise. And, for my friend who works with the trainer, this discipline outweighed any other benefit, especially when compared to the stopping, starting, chopping and changing most of us go through when left to our own devices.There is evidence of this value. In an academic article in the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine titled “The Effectiveness of Personal Training on Changing Attitudes Towards Physical Activity,” the author claims that “one-on-one personal training is an effective method for changing attitudes and thereby increasing the amount of physical activity. Secondly, it seems that using problem-solving techniques is of value for successful behaviour change.” (1)As with a personal trainer, it’s a financial adviser’s job to change their client’s “attitudes” and provide key “problem solving” techniques that improve their client’s financial health.Ben Graham, who wrote one of the most referenced books on investments titled The Intelligent Investor, once quipped, “An investor’s chief problem – and even his worst enemy – is likely to be himself”.Graham, who died in the 1970’s, would not have heard of behavioural finance. But he knew by experience what hundreds of academic articles have subsequently proven regarding poor investor behaviour.In a 2011 paper titled “The Behaviour of Individual Investors” (2), Professors Brad Barber and Terrance Odean summarise two decades of work into the poor performance of individual investors.Their five conclusions were that, in general, individual investors:1. Underperform standard benchmarks (e.g. a low-cost index fund)2. Sell winning investments while holding losing investments (the ‘disposition effect’)3. Are heavily influenced by limited attention and past return performance in their purchase decisions4. Engage in naïve reinforcement learning by repeating past behaviours that coincided with pleasure, while avoiding past behaviours that generated pain5. Tend to hold undiversified share portfoliosThey state, “these behaviours deleteriously affect the financial well-being of individual investors”.In fact, there have been significant efforts made to quantify the impact on investors who reject a buy and hold market portfolio and instead allow their decisions to be influenced by fear, hunches, intuition, hope or even greed.Professor Barber himself wrote a study which showed that individuals trading portfolios underperformed the broad market by 3.8% a year (3).Financial research company DALBAR, has also attempted to quantify the effects of poor behaviour on investors’ long-term returns. According to their 2016 study (4), the average individual investor underperformed the broad sharemarkets by 2.89% over the past 20 years.DALBAR made the following observation:Investors lack the patience and long-term vision to stay invested in any one fund for much more than four years. Jumping into and out of investments every few years is not a prudent strategy because investors are simply unable to correctly time when to make such moves. In the image below, DALBAR noted nine behavioural reasons why investors have done so poorly, which an adviser must systematically try to correct.The job of an adviser is to counteract each of these common biases which will otherwise undermine good, sound, long term investment decision making. And, as supported by the DALBAR (and other) research, this is often the greatest value an adviser can deliver.As the saying goes, “We don’t have people with investment problems; we have investments with people problems”.To change behaviour, an adviser must help each client define what they really want their money to achieve for them in life. The adviser must then substantially increase the probability that their client is able to achieve those outcomes. The key is to help clients make smarter investment decisions and prioritise what matters to them the most. The best advice is honest and sometimes confronting, but it is decisive and adaptable to changes in markets and lifestyle.It's not that investing is difficult, it’s just difficult for most individuals to do it consistently well. Like exercise, it’s not about making a big effort every once in a while. Great advice is best to be implemented consistently and carefully over a long period of time.Investors would do well to think of their financial adviser as their personal (financial) trainer. Not just because an adviser is more likely to help us make better long-term investment decisions, but because he or she will keep us motivated and on track when we might otherwise succumb to poor behaviour. After all, it’s a bit harder to say, “Exercise? I thought you said extra fries” when your personal trainer is on your team.

"The case for (or against) Cash, Term Deposits or Bonds",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579467888267-OCVU7YK23R65WQBQ3M82/ammendment+.jpg?format=original,"This week senior financial adviser and head of investment at FoxPlan, Warwick Walker delves in to whether investing in to cash/term deposits or bonds is really a sound strategy for growing your wealth.Both Australia & New Zealand's economies have got kicked around in the last 2 months resulting in the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), followed by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) moving to historic low interest rates. Both banks are looking to stimulate growth in their respective economies and support the outlook for employment and inflation. In addition, Adrian Orr, New Zealand’s Reserve Bank Governor has attempted to talk up the benefits for businesses and home owners that now is a good time to borrow and invest, while the cost of capital is at historic lows.The reverse though is true for those with only savings in bank deposits, such as those saving up for a house or retirees. Often these people have not taken advice on what alternatives are available. Record low interest rates mean that after taking into account tax and inflation, purchasing power is rapidly eroding. This can be seen in the chart below, which compares how cash has performed against other asset classes: Source: Morningstar (returns) and RBNZ (inflation)While past returns are not an indication of what various assets might do in the future, those who have held cash for short term needs, and invested a portion of their funds into growth assets such as shares, have fared much better than those invested in bank deposits. The key is using low cost, widely diversified index style funds, rather than holding just 5/10 or 50 individual shares.At FoxPlan, our Advisers can help you work out how much return you need to receive in order to maintain or grow the purchasing power of your money. How long you need your money to last, or when you need to access your capital, combined with your capacity and capability to withstand volatility, helps determine the appropriate mix of cash, bonds and shares you need.If you or someone you know could benefit from a review, please feel free to email info@foxplan.nz for an obligation free review.

The evidence for FoxPlan's Investment Philosophy,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579469557229-OD85SAQJ7N4F2DKC6Y5O/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"This week senior financial adviser and head of investment at FoxPlan, Warwick Walker delves in to our investment philosophy and the hard-data that supports it.We understand that many investors we work for have little interest in the nuances of investment management. However, we know you do care about your goals and that you trust FoxPlan to allocate an appropriate portfolio to help you achieve your goals.What we are often asked though, is how we choose funds, funds managers and why we don’t use other particular managers? So this month we want to provide more information about why we have the investment philosophy we subscribe to, the difference that makes to the fund managers chosen and the difference we think it makes for you.At FoxPlan, we don’t recommend investment managers that do the following (known as active fund managers):1. Believe they know more than markets and concentrate portfolios into a few selections2. Try to time when to get in and out of markets3. Charge high fees commensurate with their claims about skillYou might be thinking, why not try to time markets? Why not concentrate my portfolio into the investments I think are likely to beat the market?Whilst some fund managers have achieved high returns through these actions you might be surprised to know there is overwhelming evidence which shows attempts to manage investments this way does not work for most investors.When measured objectively, managers that use these techniques on average, have lower returns than a comparative market benchmark. In addition, while this is typically true over one year periods, it is almost always true over 10 to 15 year periods.Standard and Poor’s (S&P) measure the returns of ‘active’ managers against an appropriate benchmark every year and publicly share the results. The chart below shows the percentage of these fund managers that outperform their market benchmark across several countries: Cutting through the data – in the US only 16% of actively managed funds performed better than their comparative market benchmark.We’ve highlighted the US to show that regardless of population or market competition the average returns of active managers are lower than their local benchmark and, on this basis, we have no reason to expect New Zealand would be any different.The data from S&P also shows that it doesn’t matter whether investments are in large, small, inexpensive or growing companies – the average active manager does worse than the market in which they invest.What this means for youA lot.Using US market data we can see the average active fund underperformed the benchmark by 1.4% over the last 15 years. On a 15 year average, the S&P 500 returned 7.93%, actively managed funds returned 6.5% over the same timeframe.1.4% may not seem a lot but in real figures, it adds up. If you had invested $1,000,000 in 2004 you would be $570,000 worse off compared to the market benchmark. If you had invested $500,000 in 2004 the difference would be $285,000. These sums are not inconsequential!So why doesn’t everyone follow our philosophyTo earn that extra return you must do something very simple, yet very hard. You need the discipline to ignore the chatter, marketing, media and noise from investment managers; those touting their recent (usually only one, three or at most five year) track records and performance, and the promise of riches they will bring you if you switch your portfolio to them.You also need to ignore the relentless headlines predicting doom and gloom and stay disciplined in the markets. The 15 years this data collected over spans 2004 – 2018, a period not exactly the easiest in which to stay invested.And that is the FoxPlan investment philosophy. It’s about time in the market, not timing the market.If you would like to learn more about investing with FoxPlan, please email info@foxplan.nz to arrange a meeting with one of our investment advisers.

"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of Buy Now Pay Later",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1663041977513-5SZJZAQ5IV8ABDXQ8IAK/bnpl.png?format=original,"Buy Now pay later schemes have been a hot topic at the FoxPlan office for the past few weeks and it seems to be a popular product for most Kiwis as well! [caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""620""] These stats have been taken from a 2019 article by NZ herald - Source New Zealand Post [/caption] Buy now, pay later (BNPL) providers offer short-term, interest-free loans that people can use to buy anything from groceries to clothes and electronics. Recently it was reported that as a nation Kiwis are racking up over $800 million a year through Buy Now Pay Later schemes – this number was a lot larger than we thought it was going to be. Therefore, we wanted to explore how and why these products are so fashionable - or is it more to do with buying fashion? When asking different generations what Buy now Pay Later conjured in their minds the younger generations saw this mainly as afterpay, Layby, Klarna and similar product options available to them when shopping online/ on the high street and the older generations talked more about the ‘long term’ BNPL products such as car finance or a mortgage. So, we changed the question and asked everyone if ‘buy now pay later is a good tool for money management?’ and this erupted into a great online and offline debate but something we did all agree on was that there are an endless number of ways to borrow money.Let us look at some of the statistics from Finders research report on BNPL usage within New Zealand: 31% of Kiwis have used a BNPL service within the past three yearsBNPL is the most popular with younger Kiwis – 52% of Gen Z and 44% of Millennials have used the service within the past three years, compared to just 10% of Baby Boomers.Around 17% of Kiwis are carrying debt through BNPL services, with the average outstanding balance sitting at $418. Around 38% of the population are extremely or somewhat concerned with their current level of debt, but this figure jumps to 63% for those with BNPL debt.The biggest concern that our financial advisers had when discussing BNPL was our clients using it incorrectly and incurring late fees; “ in many cases it would probably be cheaper to pay a small nominal amount of interest each month on a credit card rather than to fall behind on the BNPL repayments”. We thought this was an interesting approach to BNPL and its noted that BNPL has been linked to a decline in credit card usage over the past couple of years. Buy Now Pay later is not a money management tool and due to the nature of the product and the influence it has had on societies’ spending habits we should take it for what it is – a short term interest free loan. If you can manage the repayments and manage your money in a sensible way, there is no reason you can’t use a BNPL scheme to purchase items that will help you in your life.But.. and it’s a rather large BUT…If you are already lacking in the skills to manage your money correctly and you are often late in your repayments and find yourself having to ‘ layby’ the essentials it would pay to chat to a financial adviser about making your money work for you and reduce your reliance on BNPL schemes. Even if all BNPL were to disappear tomorrow, the behavioral changes it has influenced within society need to be addressed as we undoubtedly have higher consumption levels, and a dependency on short-term debt services and a love for instant gratification. Its not all doom and gloom in the buy now pay later space but approach it the same way you would any loan – with caution and pay it back when you must.

The missing piece of the KiwiSaver discussion,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579457195196-0LZ5YBQ8P9EBG762F0P7/FoxPlan%2BKiwiSaver%2BBlog.jpg?format=original,"Last week the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) released their annual KiwiSaver report with a key takeaway being that of the $57 billion Kiwis have invested, $480 million was collected in fees by KiwiSaver providers last year (around 0.8% of total funds invested).We find news around KiwiSaver tends to be cyclical – when the discussion in the media isn’t about fees, it goes to performance before coming back to fees again.Fees and performance are important considerations when choosing a KiwiSaver provider, but we at FoxPlan believe Kiwis are not getting the full picture in the media around the single most critical factor – fund suitability.What else do I need to consider?Fund suitability is simply being in the right type of fund allocation for your current life stage.For any long-term KiwiSaver, fund suitability is the measure that will drive a difference usually in the hundreds of thousands of dollars range. To understand suitability, it’s important to know the usual types of KiwiSaver funds that are offered by most providers:Default (Defensive): lowest return/lowest volatility – KiwiSavers are entered into this type of fund generally when they sign up to the scheme or change providers without instructionsConservative: lower return/more volatility – this fund type is usually appropriate for those very near to retirement or looking to use KiwiSaver for a first home depositBalanced: moderate return/moderate volatility – a fund type for those with retirement on the horizon or that do not wish to be subject to major volatilityGrowth: high return/high volatility – appropriate for investors with a long-term investment horizon (10+ years)If we use the FMA’s KiwiSaver Tracker data, a stark contrast emerges around the difference each fund type can have (returns based on a 5-year average). If we assume performance in the middle of the road and apply this to a $100,000 fund with absolutely no contributions for a five-year period, the end dollar values show it all:Default (Defensive): 0 - 9.9% growth $105,000Conservative: 10 - 34.9% growth $122,500Balanced: 35 - 62.9% growth $148,950Growth: 63 - 89.9% growth $176,450We know that already over 400,000 New Zealanders are in a default KiwiSaver fund (more than 10% of KiwiSavers). It’s likely a great deal more are also in other inappropriate types of funds for their stage of life.A bit more on FeesAn apples with apples comparison between providers is not always easy to do. Many funds offer additional benefits such as direct access to KiwiSaver advisers, accidental death insurance cover or accessibility to reduced mortgage rates.It’s also important to understand that fees for growth and balanced funds will be higher than default and conservative funds. These fund types require higher levels of oversight and analysis to ensure KiwiSavers are getting value for their money so carry higher administrative costs.Finally, providers in the market vary by investment approach. Funds such as Booster invest directly into New Zealand through purchasing assets such as Kiwifruit orchards in the Bay of Plenty and funding Research & Development at Victoria University’s VicLink. Some providers take a far more hands-off approach with investment decisions, and others somewhere in the middle.When considering fees, our key message is to do your research and ask what value you are getting from your provider.Our adviceKiwiSavers should always make their decision on their fund provider based on fund suitability first and foremost – not switch their provider solely due to fees or performance.We also recommend that if your provider doesn’t give you the proper resources to determine a suitable risk profile – keep looking! Whether you are signing up online or by paper, you should always be given adequate tools to help determine your own fund allocation (click HERE to see an example with Booster’s handy Risk Profiler tool).Finally, if you’re not sure – come and have a chat with us. Send us an email at info@foxplan.nz to speak with one of our KiwiSaver advisers today – it costs you nothing and could be worth thousands for your future.

The Psychology Behind Buy Now Pay Later,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/2f6ee656-2a38-4dfc-80f8-65d14e51d62a/bnpl+2.png?format=original,"Why Consumers Think BNPL is NOT a ‘Debt’ and Why That Matters! Ever wonder why you're drawn to the ""buy now, pay later"" option when you're shopping online? It turns out that there's some really interesting psychology behind why consumers are drawn to BNPL schemes, and why they often don't see them as a form of debt and as Financial Advisers we are always interested in understanding why people think and behave the way they do – especially when it involves money! The bottom line is that BNPL schemes are designed to appeal to our emotions, rather than our logic. And that's why they can potentially be so dangerous.Firstly, BNPL schemes tap into our desire for instant gratification. We live in a world where we expect to get what we want, when we want it. BNPL schemes allow us to have what we want now, and pay for it later. This is especially appealing to younger consumers who haven't yet learned the value of delayed gratification.Secondly, BNPL schemes play on our FOMO (fear of missing out). If everyone else is using these schemes to buy the latest must-have items, then we don't want to be left behind. The pressure to keep up with our peers can be strong, and BNPL schemes make it easy to do just that.Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, BNPL schemes exploit our cognitive biases. We humans are notoriously bad at making rational decisions when it comes to money. BNPL schemes take advantage of this by making it easy to spend money that we may not have, and may not be able to afford. Don't Be Played a Financial FoolIt's no secret that people love a good deal. Whether we're talking about clothes, food, or even experiences, we're always on the lookout for ways to save money and get more for our hard-earned cash. So, it's no surprise that the ""buy now, pay later"" model has become so popular in recent years with Millennials and Gen-Zers. If you are prone to making impulse purchases these offers can be especially tempting.People who aren't eligible for credit cards or loans will often qualify for BNPL programs because there's no formal credit check this unfortunately can place two groups at risk of making purchases they won’t be able to pay back: People with no credit, such as teens and young adults. They may lack the financial literacy to know their budget and cash flow and whether they will be able to make payments when they are due. They may not understand the fees for usage or fines for late payments. Those with poor credit. This may include people who have overextended their credit. People with addiction issues, such as drug or alcohol problems, gambling, or compulsive spending may also be susceptible. BNPL perpetuates and exacerbates financial problems as well as addictive and compulsive behaviours.Beware of the ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ Psychological Pitfall‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ schemes will always appeal to our impulsive nature. It’s very easy to make an impulse purchase when you don’t have to pay for it immediately. This can be especially true if you’re using credit or store cards which offer interest-free periods.To prevent falling into the temptation of BNPL, consider the following:BNPL makes it easier to overspend. Psychologically, the four payments make the hefty price tag sound better by presenting them in seemingly manageable bites. If you do this regularly, it's easy to lose track of when your payments are due.Fees can add up. Just like credit cards if you miss payments, you may be charged a late fee.BNPL can be hard to manage. If you sign up for more than one service, it can be hard to keep track of payments as most are due every two weeks, not monthly like credit cardsBNPL may affect a loan application. Lenders consider BNPL spending when applying for a car loan or home mortgage.Healthier alternatives to BNPL include only buying what one can pay for in cash, paying off credit cards in full and seeking professional help.So ask yourself, is the instant gratification really worth it?

The Sense of Long Term Loss,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1586674296906-1650MIOAJBWBCOBP89B2/WW.png?format=original,"I was talking to my neighbour Sue on Monday. Sue is a spritely 70-year-old widow, who spends much of her days helping children read at one of the local schools. I was checking in on her, as I do regularly just to make sure she didn’t need anything.We naturally got to talking about the Coronavirus and its impact overseas and what that might mean for us here in NZ. Sue said she had already had a call from her son, a doctor in Auckland, telling her at that at her age she shouldn’t go up to the school because overseas it’s been shown that young children are great transmitters of the virus, albeit they may not show any symptoms.I know Sue really loves contact with her family, most of whom live outside of Wellington, but she also really loves contact with the kids at the school. It is what gives her life a lot of purpose. She told me, she listened patiently to her son, the doctor, and then told him that unless the school advised otherwise, she would keep going up to help.Sue then went on to tell me that she was a young girl at a small school in the UK when the 1957 Asian Flu Pandemic arrived in England. The 1957 flu was thought to be responsible for over 3500 deaths in England & Wales alone, with some millions dying around the globe. She especially remembers it because of a particular class she took with 4 other girls at her small school. One day they got to school, and their favourite teacher wasn’t there because she had died of the flu. As Sue told me this, I saw for the briefest of moments a look, that showed in her eyes, that she was still affected by that memory all these years later, the loss of someone she cared about. She then said ‘’I can’t control everything and at my age Warwick, something’s going to get me, so I am carrying on as normal’’.Later in the day I was speaking to another client whose daughter gets married in a few weeks’ time. There are about 150 people invited, including over 20 family members due to fly into NZ from Europe. Naturally they are already saddened that many of them won’t now be able to make it because they wouldn’t arrive in sufficient time ahead of the wedding, to self-isolate for 14 days.Each of these people - Sue, her son, the doctor and the couple whose daughter is about to get married, all sensed, or are afraid of loss. The doctor feared for his mum Sue, Sue the actual loss of the beloved teacher and the woman getting married, a sense of missing out on happy times with loved ones. No one mentioned money in all this, rather the loss of loved ones or time with them was the overarching emotion.A sense of loss of wealth is also real and gripping many as a result of the Coronavirus. It is a real emotional response to something outside of their, and all of our control. What we can control are two things. Firstly, our emotional response, which will determine our subsequent actions. Secondly, we can also control how we have our wealth structured, so therefore what it will provide in the future.If our wealth is all tied up in cash our emotions will be one of relief when market volatility strikes. This will also be combined with long periods of loss of control as we see low bank returns, tax and inflation eat away at our purchasing power.If it is all in property, we will enjoy tax free capital gains and a steady income stream. This will also be combined with worries about what the Government will do next to us as landlords, lack of liquidity, and the often low returns compared to the large capital value tied up in the property.Of course, if you’ve had all of your money in shares you will have enjoyed that last 10 years of unparalleled returns, far and away outstripping the effects of tax and inflation. This is also combined with periods, such as now, when volatility strikes and values drop rapidly.So, what to do? We know there are things we can and those we cannot control. Diversification allows us to control our investment outcome, which helps preserve long term wealth and so have some effect on our emotions in times such as these. Diversification provides the benefits of all the asset classes, each helping offset the downsides of the others.

The Term Deposit Trap,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579608053356-NJA3T8HDRJ9ETS3DM8RH/The+Term+Deposit+Trap.jpg?format=original,"This week FoxPlan founder and director John Killick shares his thoughts on the fear that Kiwi investors often allow themselves to be guided by when making investment decisions.If investing in NZ’s top stocks is generating a 5.3% dividend yield and a 6% non-taxable capital gain, why would you leave money in a term deposit? You can currently select term deposit time frames and ‘enjoy’ the fruits of the yield (i.e. interest rates), so too can you receive interest payments from ‘the NZ dividend fund’ every July and December – and your capital is not constrained by a term, it is liquid.At a recent investment workshop, I was questioned about the likelihood of ongoing dividends from this source – in other words, the security of capital and/or the security of income.Kiwis are fixated by fear of market volatility. NZ’s leading companies trade in the same market as NZ/Australasian banks. Their objectives are not dissimilar. Profit for shareholders, growth of revenue, service to their various customers and their governance at least if not better, managed. But understanding how capital markets work and why shares markedly outperform bonds and cash is beyond comprehension for many – and where there is doubt, driven by bias or disbelief, investors flock to what they perceive is safety (i.e. fixed interest investments in banks or conservative asset allocations in their KiwiSaver funds). It is costing investors big time and while the media and talking heads focus to fees and ‘responsible investing’, investors sit in naive optimism hoping their money is ‘safe’ and growing nicely in fixed interest oblivion.My belief is that as a nation we haven’t grown up ‘financially speaking’ – we remain stalled in the headlights of a social democracy flip flopping between the ‘capitalism’ of Key/English and the ‘social conscience’ of Arden/Robertson. As a nation we make up less than half of 1% of the world’s capital markets (the total shareholding of international companies) and Australia only 2%. The banks and financial institutions we hold as our security blankets are a mere blip in a thriving international economy.Like Greece or Spain in the European Union, Australasia does not compete or compare with the likes of the US (48%), UK (6%) or Japan (8%).Shares in the great companies of the world have always outperformed fixed interest by a margin of 300% - in all eras, for the last two hundred years (real return after inflation and taxes). There is no time in history when investors have lost money in a well-diversified equity investment over a twenty-year time frame. The percentage of rolling periods with positive return are 99.76% over 15 years and 83.25% over three years. These stats are a testament to the phenomenally curative aspect of the free market, free enterprise system. Left to its own devices, the marketplace ultimately heals itself. In bad times, great companies have the resources to stay the course (even through the depression, companies paid dividends). When a free market goes down – and this is critical – it has never stayed down. The advance is permanent, the declines are temporary.Harking back to the money in term deposits and declining interest rates driven by Central Bank protocol (the OCR), I make a couple of points;• As my clients will attest, I promote cash reserves, whether in a bank or unit trust. But a cash reserve is not an investment – it is a cash reserve for emergencies and opportunities – a back stop. Just like a spare tyre or a parachute – we hope not to have to call on it, but are grateful when needed. A component of risk management. Without cash reserves, I would not propose investors be fully invested in equities.• Secondly, as a short-term measure for accumulation, cash (whether bank savings accounts or term deposits) is the ideal.• Thirdly, where investors have missed the boat and there are minimal retirement savings, there is no point in paying fees to ‘planners’ or fund managers – whatever the investment return it isn’t going to improve their lifestyle.But where investors are using term deposits because they ‘fear’ capital market Armageddon and are thus adjusting lifestyle downwards to match a declining income - it is disappointing, and it needn’t be so.The first rule of investing is to make a first-class plan – with a first-class adviser.If you would like to have a conversation about investing with a first-class adviser, please email info@foxplan.nz to arrange a meeting with one of our investment advisors.The views and opinions expressed in this newsletter are not intended to be a personalised service for an individual retail client.

The Ultimate Guide to Retirement Planning,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1715814610117-6HTA10D45BHNZIYMGUW5/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"Ask anyone who's retired, and they will say to start saving for retirement as soon as you can!Even if it seems a long way away, it pays to start planning for retirement as early as possible. How much you need to save will depend on your circumstances, but the sooner you start, the better the position you’ll be in when you eventually stop working. While NZ Super (the government pension) can help get you by, it's your savings and investments that will help to make retirement more comfortable and enjoyable. In this guideCalculate how much you will need to retireFigure out where your retirement money will come fromShould I get rid of debt before retirement?Are trusts worth it?Calculate how much you'll need for retirement.Everyone has different retirement demands. To figure yours out, consider how long you might be retired, what kind of lifestyle you'd like, and where you'll reside. How many years of retirement should I plan for?Nowadays, people live longer lives. On average, 65-year-old females can expect to live to 86 years old, and males can expect to live to 83. And then what happens to your retirement funds if you live until 95? You’re going to want to factor that possibility in.There is no 'retirement age' in New Zealand. NZ Super is paid from the age of 65, but you do not have to quit working to receive it. More and more people are working beyond the age of 65, whether full-time or part-time.Let’s assume you plan to retire at 65. You would need to save and invest or have another way to supply enough income for 25-30 years or more, while also ensuring that your money is going to last as long as you do. What type of retirement lifestyle do I want?How much would it cost you to live in retirement? Some prices may rise (such as healthcare), while others (such as education, clothing, housing, and business trips) may fall (especially if you have children, they will likely be financially independent when you retire).Would you rather live a no-frills or choices lifestyle? The first is rather simple, while the second is more comfortable, with some extras and bonuses. For example, a couple living in Wellington may have a more flexible lifestyle that costs $1423 per week, whereas a pair living somewhere more rural like Levin may pay less, at $1137.You should also consider your retirement goals, such as travelling overseas, joining clubs, and attending dinners and shows. Much of this is determined by your 'bucket list'. If you don’t have a bucket list, start with our Goal Planning Worksheet. Will I rent, have a mortgage, or own my home entirely in retirement?Renting requires more funds to cover the cost, but you will not have money invested in a property. If you decide to retire with a mortgage, you will need to plan accordingly.Owning a debt-free home eliminates the danger of rent rises or having to move. You will have more control over your funds, but you will be responsible for maintenance, insurance, and rates.Being mortgage-free by retirement is an excellent goal to strive toward. Many people in retirement can manage their finances since they no longer have to worry about mortgage payments.Once you have thought about how you want your retirement life to look, have a play with our Spending Planner and map out how much you want to spend in each area during your retirement. Determine where your retirement money will come from.Given that you could be retired for 30 years, you will require a steady income. Most New Zealand residents over 65 receive NZ Super every fortnight.Approximately 40% of New Zealanders over the age of 65 rely only on NZ Super. However, most retired New Zealanders rely on their savings in addition to NZ Super.Check out the current rates for NZ Super. Is that enough to survive on?There will most likely be a difference between the income provided by NZ Super and the income you want in retirement. As a result, when planning for retirement, you'll need to consider other options. If you know your weekly, fortnightly or monthly retirement expenses, or you utilised our Spending Plan, you can easily find out your income gap by identifying the shortfall between how much the NZ Super will provide you with and your total expenses. NZ SuperNZ Superannuation is a government-paid pension for most New Zealand residents over 65.NZ Super benefits all eligible New Zealanders, regardless of income, assets, or taxes paid. Here's all you need to know about New Zealand Super, including this year's rates.Savings and InvestmentsYou may want to use the money you have saved and invested to fund your retirement years. Use our Savings/Investments Calculator to determine how much to save and invest towards your retirement objectives. Setting long-term goals can help you decide how to invest.The more reliant you are on your savings, the more conservative or 'protective' your investment strategy should be.Once you've saved for retirement, you'll need to make smart decisions about how to stretch it out over the next 30 years or more. Our Goal Planning System does a fantastic job of displaying your money in a way that makes ensuring it lasts so simple. Book a chat with an adviser to learn more and see how we can help make your money last. KiwiSaverKiwiSaver's unique perks make it an excellent choice for retirement savings.KiwiSaver members get annual government payments of up to $521 for free, in addition to your contributions and a minimum of 3% of their pay from their employers if they are working. A KiwiSaver provider then invests all of that money, which grows as a result of the returns earned. This extra money means that your savings will yield larger returns than another plan in which you are the sole contributor. This will make it easier to meet your retirement savings target. When you reach the age of 65 and are ready to utilise your KiwiSaver funds to support your retirement, you can set up regular withdrawals with your provider.Use our KiwiSaver Calculator to predict your future returns.Working during retirement.People continue to work in retirement for a number of reasons: many enjoy the work or need the money, while others may need to stop completely due to health issues. Approximately one-third of Kiwis continue to work after the age of 65. You can continue to work as usual or change your working arrangements, such as flexible hours, part-time or casual jobs, consultancy, or mentorship.Your NZ Super entitlement is unaffected by your income from paid work. However, it may have an impact on your eligibility for income-tested benefits like the Accommodation Supplement and Disability Allowance.

Downsizing Your HomeSelling a property and buying a smaller one in a less expensive neighbourhood can help you save money while still delivering the benefits of home ownership.You may intend to downsize and relocate to the regions when you retire, but this does not always work out exactly as planned. There are trade-offs to make in terms of social network and access to amenities, so living closer to a city centre may still be better. Reverse mortgagesIf you own a home or other property and need to free up funds for long-term living needs, emergencies, or a significant expense, you can use a reverse mortgage.You can borrow against your property in a flat payment or draw down the loan as needed. In the meantime, interest payments accumulate. When you die or the property is sold, the full loan plus interest must be returned, resulting in a lesser inheritance.When considering a reverse mortgage, it is advisable to consult with family and seek independent financial and legal advice. It is critical to understand how the product works and what it may cost (including fees and interest costs). When calculating cost forecasts, you can employ a 'worst-case scenario' approach rather than assuming a property's value will improve. Speak to one of our mortgage experts to see if a reverse mortgage could be for you.Other ways to generate income from your homeThere are other options you can consider to release value from your home:Rent out part of your homeTake in a boarderSubdivide your propertySell your home to family or whānau (while retaining the right to live in it)Should I get rid of my debt before retiring?Paying off debt in retirement might be challenging, so make it a goal to be debt-free before you retire. To begin your retirement strategy, prioritise paying off any high-interest debt, such as credit cards or hire purchases. Whether to pay off the mortgage or notThe next objective is to pay off your mortgage before retiring, but this should not be your primary retirement strategy.Mortgage interest can exceed after-tax savings returns, with the exception of KiwiSaver due to incentives.However, there are hazards in delaying major retirement savings until after you've paid off your mortgage. You may end up with a mortgage for longer than expected due to changes in your circumstances, such as illness or job loss, that limit your ability to make repayments. A life-changing event, such as separation, can disrupt your plans.The short version is that it is ideal to pay off debt, pay off your mortgage, and save for retirement at the same time. Are trusts worthwhile?People typically create trusts so that they no longer legally own their home or other assets, but can still use and enjoy them as 'beneficiaries' of the trust. The most frequent forms of trusts used by retirees are family trusts and burial trusts, which should be thoroughly researched beforehand to ensure they perform as intended.Family trustsFamily trusts entail selling assets to a trust, such as a house. Family trusts can be complicated and time-consuming to manage. It costs money to put them up, and there are continuous legal and accounting expenses. Prepaid funeral trustsPrepaid funeral trusts allow you to pay for funeral expenditures in advance. Funeral trusts worth up to $10,000 are not considered assets when Senior Services determines eligibility for the Residential Care Subsidy.",,"Wed, 15 May 2024 23:06:45 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
Thoughts from the Chair #1  (Copy),,"We are thrilled to announce the launch of ""Thoughts from the Chair,"" a captivating new blog by our esteemed Chairman, John Killick! Stay tuned for his thought-provoking insights in the upcoming blog posts as we embark on this exciting journey together.Accepting personal responsibilityI’m not sure if others are feeling the frustration that I do as our society and community appear so disrupted and disaffected at the present, yet our leaders seem entrenched in the maintenance of power and control. It reminds me of my teenage years (the 60s) when Mum and Dad ‘were always right’ – to my chagrin. But they missed the revolution of change occurring around us at the time, it was a fast-moving societal sensation.Rock musicThe contraceptive pill10 o’clock closingThe arrival of cannabisThe Vietnam War The hippie generation – freedom vs fiefdomIt felt wonderful and invigorating – we didn’t totally reject the norms, but we pushed the boundaries. That’s not the liberal environment I see now with our Millennials and Gen Zs. At least not from my perception. As a teenager I recognised and welcomed the dialogue and debate of the time – but I also observed that not all ‘authority’ was as portrayed. One only had to observe behaviours at sporting clubs, theatre, and community gatherings to witness the reality of life – from parents, teachers, policemen, firemen, professionals, councillors, business owners, iwi, let alone politicians. They were not then nor are they now, above reproach. It is possible to disagree and debate without reverting to caterwauling and the shouting down of people with dissenting views – which we see on one hand whilst on the other this seemingly blind acceptance of authoritarian directive. What of those fast-moving societal sensations of today, what are they and do we see the ‘party’ of the 60s, the careless days of the 70s or the ‘pain’ of the 80s – or is it the ‘prescription’ of the 2020s – prescribed by politicians, medical professionals, and public service personnel?ClimateSocial mediaPolitical progressivismGender and RacismMental health / suicideInfluencers – media moguls, authoritarian regimes, pharmaceuticals, big tech, unelected officials, the rich and ‘famous’War in EuropeThe collapse of societal balance (divisions) (personality vs policy) (party vs people)You’ll note the difference from the 60s model – we were on happy pills – the modern young generation is overly prescribed, not for fun and frivolity but with anti-depressants.My point?In a few months, the country gets an opportunity to select our representatives and thereby our government. Our progressive future as a country and community however, will not come from political parties and politicians – it will come from us – all genders, races, religions – all beliefs, occupations, professions – all types, academics, artists, sports personnel, farmers – willing to reconsider who really deserves ‘control’, aspiration, purpose. Power is a powerful drug and if we give it to a person or an organisation less deserving than ourselves, they will seldom relinquish it voluntarily.Correct knowledge gives ultimate power from the truth – but one needs to check the source, not all are trustworthy. Terrible regimes both current and of the past were created by immoral and corrupt politicians and power brokers who preyed upon trusting citizens too easily manipulated by storytellers, orators, and their codifying toadies.We should vote with knowledge and conscience but contribute by way of purpose, productivity, and the power of love – yourself, your family, your community. It will pay dividends many times over in comparison to hoping it will come from a political party. And whatever political party and or arrangement of same under the current MMP constituency – remember they are only ‘contractors’ – the true power rests in the bowels of the ‘public service’. The unelected officials and bureaucrats of the ‘deep state’ and they don’t change at elections – but you can because living life on purpose, with wellness, meaning, and security is what life is really all about and we only have one shot at it. So, hold your nose and vote but smile and get on with living – enjoying times with those you love – I can recommend it!",,"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 20:33:57 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
Thoughts from the Chair #3 (Copy),https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1688682086773-7B546YIHSVOGMF5787MP/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"First things firstI suspect the entrepreneurial spirit and management capability were initially imbued in me as a youngster watching and learning from my parents. Both of whom ran separate businesses and did so collaboratively. They worked well together and we kids were an integral part of each. A café/milk bar/dairy, and a four-car taxi service – with a speciality in weddings. 7-day-a-week services (and for the taxi service, 24 hours a day) This was in the 50s and 60s in small town NZ. The town had four pubs, two banks, a post office, two constables and a sergeant of police, a traffic officer, two doctors, (both of whom did house calls) four primary schools, a secondary school, a picture theatre, memorial hall, a maternity home, old peoples home, Jaycees, Lions, Rotary, Little theatre, senior rugby and cricket teams, a golf club – and an industry which employed a large number of workers and paid them well (I know because I helped fill their pay packets every week at the CBA bank) The manufacturer – NZ Woolpacks and textiles – making woolpacks from flax. The flax cutters were the big earners (and spenders)Most of us that have built a business or managed a business at a senior level know that ‘dealing with change’ is necessarily a primary focus – or needs to be. One cannot afford to go to sleep at the wheel. The same for life. People develop experience in many ways, the more experience we have, the better we get. In business, an important focus is to make a profit. In life, it is surely wellness, meaning, contribution, and peace of mind. But just as small-town NZ no longer has the same level of services and industry it once provided to its citizens, the drivers of change which affected business are the same for families – and the answers are no different. What took generations to create, service and supply in Foxton – changed in 20 years, dramatically. The same in Tokoroa where I lived, worked, and started a family in the 70s. In both instances, the manufacturing industry changed the landscape – because the owners were responding to their environment. They needed to change to survive. The most common initiator of the need for change in business will be a weakening of financial performance. Most stresses in life stem from monetary issues. Next for both – probably the impact these days of new technologies and their effect upon our social and business structure. If we felt a two-decade transition created chaos just imagine the impact of AI. We’ve recently experienced banks in the US go broke overnight – bank runs can now happen in hours due to technology and instant settlements.When I left college and joined the financial services industry in Foxton our currency system in NZ was – pounds, shillings, and pence! All / most transactions were with coins and paper (cheques and notes) We manually calculated fees and interest – there were no mortgage loans for housing (that remained with solicitor trust funds and Building societies). The same year I left banking, the US government cut the link between gold reserves and money. Today banks lend close to 90% of money with no reserves. They rely on people not all wishing to withdraw their savings at the same time. In some Western countries governments will bail out banks or at least create a minimum guarantee for depositors’ savings. Not in NZ. Once a saver in NZ deposits their money in the bank – they (you) no longer own it, you have lent it to the bank. In 2016 in India, their government directed money through the banking system by eliminating legal tender via the removal of large currency notes. The big agenda. A cashless society. Control – but not by you. In Europe and Japan, negative interest rates have meant savers/depositors were charged interest. A cashless society also provides authoritative governments with the ability to take taxes on the spot, create instant fines with instant payment, and switch off credit. Imagine the business not operating with ESG requirements or the individual having their credit cancelled at the airport just as they were to take a holiday in Fiji! Sounds improbable, it's already happening.The capability for AI to change the landscape is immense – whole industries will be threatened. Artificial intelligence can respond to unscripted questions on any subject to create entirely new content, based on data its had access to - with a steadily increasing development and role. New AI has smart video recognition (for example – just type in raw instruction) it can create bespoke background music (not existing tunes – it makes its own), sound effects, captions, and storyboards. (All from raw request) Think it might change marketing and business? You bet! If we don’t keep changing, if we don’t keep improving, if we don’t keep innovating, if we don’t stay alert – our destiny will be determined more and more by an authoritative overseer or system we will regret. The transformation needs to come from the bottom up (the people) not the top down – the power brokers, politicians, and big corporates. First things first means we focus on what’s important in life to get ourselves sorted as a first step - that enables us to plan and prepare for what may be coming around the corner via disruption, and change – whether positive or negative. It’s called life-stage planning and it starts with getting clarity of purpose.",,"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 20:33:13 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
Thoughts from the Chair #4 (Copy),https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1689895870967-MAV32KP4YI50FPV65MIC/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"Think win/winThe major source of information in today's ‘enlightened’ world emanates from, mainstream media, social media, and political PR – it’s hardly win/win.Often in life, sport, and business, we are dealt ‘cards’ which are seemingly loaded against us and how we play the hand determines our destiny. Some prosper, for others, it gets too hard. The NZ statistics for prescribed anti-depressants for those up to the age of 19, went from 5% in 2018 to 18% in 2021. For those aged 19 – 21, it doubled. And if we were to obtain statistics which relate to the opposite end of NZ demographics (people in rest homes) I think we would be astounded – although I think they are prescribed for very different reasons. Recent information from a large NZ health insurer tells us that claims (all health issues) have gone from 400/500 per day pre-pandemic to 700 per day post-pandemic. Wellington regional hospitalisations – heart attacks up 83%, stroke 25%, myocarditis 33%, acute kidney issues 40%. Our hospitals are train wrecks – it’s no wonder, these are frightening statistics, and the hospitals are filled with vaccinated covid patients, but you wouldn’t know it unless you moved beyond government propaganda.Life insurance companies price their premiums on morbidity and mortality – related to demographics. The pricing will inevitably increase. Those ‘smart’ clients that levelled their premiums will be eternally grateful to their insurance advisers and life-stage planners. For those that remain on yearly renewable term insurance, the reality is coming. Actuaries at all life insurance companies will be in close accord with their senior management bosses, their boards, and their owners. I can sense the tensions in the board rooms as ‘sales and marketing’ argue the case with ‘finance’. Finance will win and premiums will go up, as people are dying and becoming incapacitated at a much earlier age (in fact – working ages). The narrative is ‘long covid’ – we’ll know in time if that is truly the cause.Thank goodness the four courageous Colombian children (aged 13, 9, 4, and 11 months) listened to their mother. “leave me and go find food” Grandma said (via search and rescue) “Stay where you are so it’s easier to find you” 40 days later the kids are found – alive. Sometimes mixed messages confuse – and we need to make a choice, at times the messenger seems so sincere and believable that we succumb to the devious and deliberate deception. Other times people or organisations seem so ravingly antagonistic, arrogant, or unbelievable we completely block out anything they might say or do – regardless of the truth. A couple of extreme examples are Mayor Wayne Brown – in Auckland, and Orange Man Donald Trump – in the US.In a recent article by Bruce Cotterill in the Herald he referred to feedback on Brown's mayoralty performance – much of it extremely positive. But you wouldn’t think it from the narrative in mainstream media. Those of us that have visited Auckland in the last few years know the place is hardly running in a bath of oil. Something or someone needed to change. Besides, we are experiencing similar frustrations in Wellington. Both Wellington and Washington are deeply political – centres for their political governance – both filled with unelected but politically appointed officials. When Trump was elected in 2016 on a platform of ‘draining the swamp’ he had no idea, any more than the rest of us, just how deep the swamp was, or how dirty. It is only now as their country and ours head to elections that the true depth of bureaucracy and ‘spin’ from PR doctors of deception are becoming more divisive and parochial. (Hardly win/win)The little 13-year-old Colombian girl trusted her dying mother, then took the initiative. Left her dead and dying parents and moved deeper into the jungle with her siblings in search of sustenance. The story and the message are incredibly empowering – the outcome unbelievable – the children found safe and well in an environment she was accustomed to but not one that was anything like home. I suspect that social media has a lot to do with the increase in medicated antidepressants for our NZ young people – and I doubt their Mum is who they have been listening to. The problem is that when they inevitably do (listen to Mum) and return for her cooking, comfort, and security – they will pay the price of permanent damage – either mental or metabolic – just as many in our country are now experiencing post covid vaccinations. We now know that what we thought was a vaccine is not – but a gene therapy. Whilst our politicians and their ‘expert’ advisers were convinced their mandates and directives were in our ‘best interest’ (ie win/win) I’m not as convinced that big pharma was motivated in the same way.",,"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 20:31:02 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
Thoughts from the Chair #5 (Copy),https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1691032121622-4SZGTNOQ1MU5E27TYDEA/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"KiwiSaver Rental Bond PolicyNational’s KiwiSaver rental bond policy should not be seen as being worthy of debate. It is neither a profoundly positive and socially impactful policy for renters nor a hugely negative policy for retirement planners. It is purely political. Unfortunately, political incentives get votes and democracies count people’s heads and not what’s in them.I paraphrase Vernon Small (former adviser to Labour minister David Parker) “In the tightly fought election campaign in 2005 Labour needed a circuit-breaker, the interest-free student loan policy boosted support because it had inter-generational appeal. Not just to students but also to parents and grandparents who saw the burden of debt driving family members overseas and delaying decisions to buy homes or start families. Robertson was key to the development of that loan policy”. Unquote. Labour retained power for the next three years, Michael Cullen introduced KiwiSaver in 2007 and National won the next election in 2008 (there were tough times to follow in Wellington / NZ / world – as thousands of public servants were made redundant, employers had to stump up with an additional 3% for KiwiSaver contributions, and the global financial crisis impacted with job losses and the greatest economic downturn since the great depression)Politicians will make it happen again – Labour will not hesitate to proffer direct payments to ‘deserving’ voters – or proffer subsidies for housing, home loans, or reconsider GST – especially on food. The same for National, Greens, Act, and NZ First.Unfortunately, the more politicians interfere with the fundamentals of capitalism – the more they need to find solutions for the disruption they have caused through the interference. The cycle of ‘good ideas’ ‘justifiable governance oversight’ ‘poor policy’ (lacking in due diligence, budgetary control, good managerial implementation) ‘bureaucratic inefficiencies’ (complex central planning) ‘bad outcomes’ (health, education, law and order, government spending, debt) – inevitably follow.Interest-free loans are a good example. Any experienced business owner knows that incentives to gain new business can be a double-edged sword. They will likely appeal to a ‘market’ – but seldom with long-term profitable benefits and almost always with customers who treat a ‘free lunch’ as their right – and behave in just that way. They become a servicing and support nightmare. Whilst several excuses for universities in NZ going broke have been proffered to the current government in an endeavour to secure further funding (successfully), interest-free student loans are now a huge debt conundrum for many students (some of whom have opted out and legged it from the country) and especially the incumbent government. (Whilst this op-ed is not the appropriate vehicle to discuss current education standards emanating from universities, I would have to say it is the drawing of a long bow to say that ‘capability, knowledge, and skill’ has improved – over the last 20 years because of ‘free entry’.Whilst KiwiSaver is such an attractive source of ‘free money’ for politicians – more and more ‘good ideas’ will abound as gaining power by gaining votes becomes more important than delivering policy with trustworthiness and authenticity. Power is an ‘A’ class drug – and those with it seldom like to give it up. They are not in it for you. There is no point in debating a financial product (introduced and sponsored by a government), through financial rationale. The originator and the product deserve the greatest of accolades – it was tough for employers at the time (2008) but of necessity, they have adapted – but now the lid is off the lolly jar – other people’s money has always been an attractive option for authoritarian regimes. We will see more of it before this election is over.",,"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 20:30:42 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz

I’m not sure I got the full insight into the wisdom from his assertion; however, it has stuck with me – listen, read, write, consider, question, measure success. That didn’t mean we were afforded the same opportunity around the dinner table.In lifestage planning understanding clients, intentions and aspirations is fundamental – they are not easily obtained but essential if the destination and journey are to be road mapped and implemented successfully over the long term. ‘Seek first to understand before being understood’ (habit 5 in Stephen Covey’s 7 Habits) is basic stuff through a lifestage planner’s career – whether promoting products, advising fee-based business development planning for SMEs, proffering lending options for homeowners, or delivering investment and retirement planning recommendations in an environment of constant financial and market change with associated client anxiety. Clarity of purpose and insight into people's desired lifestyle (for a lifetime) and their cash management – is important. Health, Money, and Relationships are interrelated – fail at one and all are compromised. Each is requiring of attention over a protracted period. There is no short-term fix or simple answer – and most of us know that or get to know that. Why then are our ‘superior’ houses of learning (Universities) in such a sorry state? And not just financial. If knowledge and research are such important contributors to our society – how come the academic community along with their funders, got it so wrong? Or is there a blame environment where the funding party (77% of university funding comes from the taxpayer) is accused of serial underfunding whilst the government says that universities have financial autonomy; they are responsible for their own finances and it's not the governments place to intervene in operational matters. The irony of course is that two former student association presidents (Hipkins and Robertson) are presiding over some of the deepest funding cuts to NZ universities in our political history. Hipkins at VuW and Robertson Otago. “The solution to this problem lies within the government – the way to avoid redundancies is for the government to increase funding” Chris Hipkins in the year 2000. Chris, of course, was to ultimately become the Minister of Education in the Ardern government for 5 years. In reality, the country is bearing the brunt of the pandemic as a whole – we all have been affected, but in the case of universities, they got the ‘quaddy’ – declining domestic enrolment, high inflation, seriously depleted international enrolments, and the inability to receive the governments wage subsidy scheme through lockdowns and lockouts. Redundancies are the outcome – and lots of them. For all my criticism of the university curriculum and questionable student qualification and capability, I’m not sure that losing up to 1,000 people from the academic and research sector is smart – unless the new model means operational efficiencies are obtained, all the very good teachers are retained, and research can thrive with a fairer system of budgeting and selection. Somehow I doubt it. Cost cutting is difficult work. It's emotional. It affects people’s’ lives. But sometimes it's necessary to ensure the survival of the enterprise. Academics can have practical knowledge and can have a tangible impact on society – it must be galling as the recipients of the ‘don’t come Monday’ letters consider the profligacy with which this government has distributed to consultants over failed or cancelled ‘ideas’ (of which ex-Minister Michael Woods takes the cake with the $50 million paid out for the proposed cycleway attached to the Auckland harbour bridge) In the year 2022 the taxpayers of NZ contributed almost $108 billion to help pay for the operation of this country. This compares with approximately $70 billion in 2017. A 54% increase in 5 years. We are spending $1 billion more every week than we were 5 years ago – and borrowing every dollar. Governments, just like families and businesses need to live within their means. When events occur, which inevitably they will, there must be a plan B. Unfortunately, under our present system of governance, many expect our politicians to manage and continue the policy of the previous governors, respond appropriately to cataclysmic events, foresee the future, and lead us along a well-trodden path for a purposeful life with wellness, meaning, and security. That isn’t going to happen. That’s what we need to do – and it starts at home and in school, learning how to learn. Thanks Dad!",,"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 20:27:20 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz

Couples, families, businesses of all sizes and types, team members, and of course, management and governments all prosper from co-ordination and cooperation. The rationale is that complementing strengths and weaknesses allows for greater heights of success – and of course, common goals, intentions, and aspirations being motivators for those committed. Having said that, there are always outliers – business usually – for autocrats and single-minded CEOs. I suggest that Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple would not exist today without their founders having been – autocratic. Government ministers, council executives, and board directors often have tempestuous relationships with public servants, officials within administration, and or business management. But relationships don’t tend to last with narcissists. Teams, companies, and marriages require synergy for any long-term capability. And different types of leaders are often required to step in and build upon the founders, innovators, creators, foundations, or ideas.What is interesting when reviewing successful sporting teams is the big difference a coach can make. They most often deflect personal attention, certainly deflect adulation to ‘the team’, and consistently outperform their competitors. (Pep Guardiola, Sir Alex Ferguson, Vince Lombardi, Sir Brian Lochore, Sir Wayne Smith, Scott Robertson) If a team, any team, sporting or otherwise is not performing – look at the leadership. When marriages break down – communication, collaboration, and compromise have either never existed or one of the parties believes that compatibility is irreconcilable – for any number of reasons. What are the vital points of difference that a great coach can make, for couples, teams, business, soft and hard skills;Passion (purpose)Understanding (listening/philosophy)Discipline (habits)Commitment (dedication)Persistence (determination)Character (integrity/maturity)Competence (technical ability)Trust (reliability and truth)I have followed and played team sports for many years and also coached sporting teams and business teams – with various levels of success. But it wasn’t until after my first marriage dissolved, that I began to truly grasp the importance of the list above and looked inward for the reason. It changed my life and made me a better coach (lifestage planner) manager (business) and partner (marriage) – to the extent, I’m eternally grateful to the people who have made up the ‘teams’ over my – 38 years (2nd) marriage, 27 years in business, and many years which followed in management.What I know from having been many years as a financial adviser and lifestage planner is that people, couples, and business owners, appreciate receiving ongoing advice if it has good reason (destination/journey) is consistent with agreed principles and is authentic. In other words, there is an ongoing reviewable and measurable purpose – delivering value with practical outcomes and no BS.The great coaches and successful long-term business owners know that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”.Same at home.Same in government – a leader might be admired but ‘the team’ will ultimately determine governance longevity.",,"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 20:26:57 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
"Timing the market, or time in the market?",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/b986f595-6a02-45ce-b40c-bf3dd04c10f9/stockimg-2-7698827.jpg?format=original,"In our June newsletter, we outlined the different strategies that we feel would be most appropriate for you, i.e. keeping cash in the bank, stock-picking, investing in many companies or alternative investments.Let’s say you have met with your financial adviser, discussed the options, and decided on the strategy. Now it is time to invest.Seeing the news and how the financial commentators provide their analysis, be it about the rising interest rates, supply chain issues, or the prospect of the economy going into recession, you decide to take a step back and reassess. Is now really the right time to invest?With all the information received, the overall market prices might further decrease. Right?So, should you invest now, wait, or dollar cost average into the market (put a smaller amount in your portfolio on a regular basis)? Let’s look at a test by the Charles Schwab Corporation, who had compared 5 investing styles as below:Consider five hypothetical investors all with different investment approaches, regarding timing their investing.The following investors all had $2,000 at the beginning of the year to invest in the S&P 500 Index, for 20 years ending 2020.1. Peter PerfectPeter was extremely lucky as he had timed the market perfectly every year. (What are the chances of that?)He waited and invested the $2,000 at the lowest point of each year. For example, in 2001, he invested in the S&P 500 on September 21, 2001 – the year’s lowest closing level.2. Ashley ActionAshley took immediate action, where she invested $2,000 in the market on the first trading day of the year.3. Matthew MonthlyMatthew splits his $2,000 into 12 equal portions and invested each portion at the beginning of each month.4. Unfortunate UmbridgeMs. Umbridge had poor timing in investing in the market. She invested $2,000 each year at the market’s peak every year. (What are the chances of that?)For example, in 2001, she had invested her $2,000 on January 30, 2001 – the year’s highest closing level.5. Larry LingerLarry anticipated purchasing when the market further plummets, however, decided to pull the handbrakes when the market prices went back up. He was convinced to keep his capital available to purchase stocks at lower prices that were just around the corner.Larry eventually did not invest in the S&P 500 and invested in Treasury bills each year. The results:A study from Schwab Center for Financial Research found that in a span of 20 years from 2001 to 2020, Peter Perfect, who perfectly timed the market had the greatest return, while Ashley Action, came second, followed by Matthew Monthly, Unfortunate Umbridge, and lastly Larry Linger. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Invested $2,000 annually in a hypothetical portfolio that tracks the S&P 500® Index from 2001-2020.The individual who never bought stocks in the example invested in a hypothetical portfolio that tracks the lbbotson U.S. 30-day Treasury Bill Index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. The examples are hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. They are not intended to represent a specific investment product, and investors may not achieve similar results. Dividends and interest are assumed to have been reinvested, and the examples do not reflect the effects of taxes, expenses, or fees. Had fees, expenses, or taxes been considered, returns would have been substantially lower. The difference between the first and second place is $15,920. While timing the market would be the most apparent approach, it is near impossible to time the market consistently over a long period of time.Let’s take Covid’s recent impact on the market for example.29 December 2019 - Chinese authorities advise the WHO of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, originating in Wuhan, Hubei province[1].9 - 15 March 2020 - Stock markets crashed after instability due to the pandemic. What some labeled as ""Black Monday 2020"" was, at that time, the Dow's worst single-day point drop in U.S. market history. Also, S&P 500’s lowest closing in 2020[2].23 August 2020 - The losses from this record-breaking crash were fully recovered by 23 August, only five months after the market bottomed and while the global economy was still deep in a quagmire[3].Timing the market requires an investor to preempt that once the news about Covid-19 broke out in December, the markets will go down. They actually went the other way for more than a month, before the sudden drop, through to mid- February when they reached their lowest point.An investor who attempts to time the market not only had to predict the direction and movement of the market, but they also needed to pinpoint the lowest closing day of the year, consistently, which is extremely unlikely.Timing the market requires an extensive time commitment, knowledge, and a large degree of luck. Because many investors are occupied with work, family, and other pursuits, they might not be able to invest at the lowest point of each year. Hence, investing immediately, or to dollar cost average is a more realistic approach to investing.In the long run, it is better to be investing, even at the worst timing, than to not be investing at all.",,"Sun, 24 Jul 2022 23:55:33 +0000",GuestUser

Very disappointing review of the Insurance Industry by FMA &amp; RBNZ,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1582447834741-82PIEF1ZFZCDWOQ2Q7Y6/Very+disappointing+review+of+the+Insurance+Industry+by+FMA+%26+RBNZ.jpg?format=original,"Very disappointing review of the Insurance Industry by FMA & RBNZRead the full report HERE Disclaimer, I am in the financial services industry and I am proud to say that among the many kinds of advice I provide to clients, that I include advice on insurance and sell them policies. I am also about to pop my head above the parapet.I along with many others in our industry have long waited on and welcomed this review, and had high hopes for it, while for years we have jointly strived to lift standards and improve client outcomes ..........but what a disappointing and seemingly poorly researched piece of work it has turned out to be.Yes, it has correctly identified several significant structural, system & conduct issues within the industry, but it then tried to justify its suggested drastic remediation, on statistically insignificant data sets either because, the data is insignificant, or it was less than in depth research.I don’t in anyway suggest that any of the industries failings which affect clients are insignificant, and that they shouldn’t be repeated, and clients should be recompensed where they have been wronged. Nor do I disagree that some practises need to change, staff and adviser training improved, products lifecycles reviewed. I along with most good advisers welcome that. But, based on what has been produced, the changes mooted are the proverbial sledgehammer to crack a walnut.The authors recommend urgent regulatory intervention to avoid what they must see as the risk of some financial apocalypse within the industry, when again, based on stats or anecdotal evidence in the report, less than .00004 clients are affected. (I made that stat up but its better than some justification I saw in the report)Only once did the authors caution that their suggested fixes for the industry could lead to unintended consequences for clients. But then they ducked for cover and rather than suggest (a) what those might be and (b) how such unintended consequences might be mitigated, they implied “hey when we bring in these new changes if the public are disadvantaged then that’s the industries fault and the industry will have to fix our stuff up”.I guess it was because it was so poorly researched the authors / researchers have chosen to be anonymous.While its intentions are laudable, problems I see in this report are; ▪ Many times in the report it repeats that issues of conflicted remuneration leads to poor client outcomes and state the industry and advisers need to change to improve clientoutcomes. They must have based much of that on hearsay because they only spoke to 29 advisers out of a possible pool of many thousands and no clients.▪ What’s more, professional bodies who represent advisers such as FANZ, weren’t even identified in the report stakeholders within the industry or spoken to.▪ It further recommends through out that the industry must be more client focussed - and I applaud that, but its extremely light on detail regarding supposed benefits that might flow to the millions of policy holders in NZ from the suggested drastic changes the authors demanded.▪ What they have demanded will equate to multi-million-dollar investments in technology, training, product design, legal costs & client communication. If that is what is required then as an industry I hope all within it, embrace those changes. However, in the next breath, the authors seemingly ignoring the cost of such change, they suggest that by reducing commissions to advisers’ client’s premiums could be reduced by 12%. Really, where is the evidence for that, other than some bush maths? Have none of the authors ever been in business?▪ When the insurers and industry start to implement the changes demanded, where do the authors think the money come from? It will come from paying less commission, which will probably mean less sales, less insured New Zealanders, but then any savings will be diverted not to cheaper premiums, but into funding the very investment which is required.▪ The most damning is that no customers were spoken to! The authors only had to ask insurers or advisers, which they have the legal authority to do, to get access to thousands and thousands of names of customers to speak to. But I guess it wouldn’t have suited the tone of the report if it had to include customers who expressed satisfaction with their interactions with the industry. How can anyone on one hand demand the industry hold focus groups with consumers to find out what they want and be more client centric, and then on the other hand carry out a review of that industry, but fail to speak or consult with those you say you are trying to get better outcomes for?Is it only what the authors think should happen that is important? So, while I’d hoped for a great outcome for clients and an improved industry from this review, in the end I fear this is not the report that will start to deliver that. The lack of customer input, and woeful business logic, will sadly mean the Government & regulators will get what they want, but customers may notice little real change. I pray I am wrong.Scorecard▪ Instigating research into the industry to improve outcomes for clients = A+▪ Research undertaken, based on what they have put in the report = C-▪ Reported stats to justify recommended changes = D▪ Financial logic that reducing commissions and implementing the changes will enhance client outcomes & reduce premiums for clients = E▪ Lack of research into what the unintended consequences of the changes will be for the consumer = E Warwick WalkerAFA, CFP(CM) The views and opinions expressed in this newsletter are not intended to be a personalised service for an individual retail client.

"Wealth Series, Part 6: What are the likely Lifestages (Copy)",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/07670daa-4f1d-49ff-97f7-f84e1b409f87/Copy+of+holly+is+stealing+this+.png?format=original,"So what!When we formed the company 27 years ago the foundations were determined to be holistic - (treating the whole person). Our intentions were to create a service business, related to financial products but aligned with people; transitions, traumas, and transactions throughout a lifetime. For that to occur we needed to offer choice (of products and suppliers) and to ensure that the offering would stack up for a lifetime, then through generations. We chose ‘Health, Wealth, Relationships, and Habits as our tagline’. Then we needed to re-educate, find the right staff, and upscale through improved processes and systems. An infrastructure to support continuity and succession.The rationale has come from our own, our family’s, and our friends’ experiences of the previous 30 years – the health issues, the money issues, the relationship issues, and the habits which had helped to create or exacerbate those outcomes. Financial planning was not mainstream back in the mid-90s – but we had happened upon what was to become the ultimate framework for our growth and future; culture, values, and strategic approach with a conscious intent built on relationships for the long term. Delivered with professionalism and gold-standard service. Today the ‘Purpose’ (our why!) has evolved. ‘A life map to smooth the road, to ensure our client's financial affairs are in order, and there are no surprises, a planned and purposeful life with wellness, meaning, and security’ And a tagline of ‘Smooth the Road’ As my beautiful older sister tragically succumbs to the cruelty of Alzheimer’s, the reality of life and death continues its inevitable cycle for me to observe and participate in. The cycle of health, wealth, relationships, and habits. Each is intertwined – not just in old age, but throughout all our life and ultimately it will determine the length of our life. Whilst my sister’s family struggles with ‘the where and who’ to provide the care (it is beyond their capability) the ultimate reality of the fast-growing notion of our nation's demographic transition becomes even more obvious. Supply and demand for full-time aged care is no longer an ‘off the shelf’ solution. And now the financial issues become pronounced, the estate dissected (verbally initially then deconstructed in total for reallocation), and the pets, clothing, furniture, and personal items overseen with selective objectivism! One hopes. Money and Health and Relationships are there for all to see – in technicolour. Stark and real. Even whilst the life continues!Lifestages (for total financial planning) commence a lot earlier (or for 6 life stages – 6 decades) in our 20s. – and ends somewhere nearer to ones 80s or 90s. In my case (my two sisters and me) lost both our parents in their 50s, and both Grannies in their 80s. I was only 21 when my father died of cancer. (in the early 70s) So there is no normal or easy and common pathway from birth to death – one needs to consider, and plan, so one can get on with ‘living’. If not, the trials and tribulations can become overwhelming – as is the observable reality of many in society today and is the foundation of fear used by both commercial and political entities. (A growing central state to assuage your feelings of helplessness – a growing reliance on pharmaceutical companies fostered by a health industry struggling to cope but delivering medication solutions with complex long-term consequences - a climate narrative focused on impending long-term doom when many are struggling to survive the week or the month due to inflation and a rising cost of living – and atrocities in both Eastern Europe and the Middle East.Through various ‘lifestages’ differing circumstances prevail. In one's 20s there is usually a higher discretionary income, and the young haven’t yet taken on large amounts of debt (except for a student loan) Young people tend to spend rather than save but they are now much better financially speaking than in my generation because KiwiSaver has introduced a semi-compulsory investment habit. And with it – an awareness of asset classes albeit ‘not extensive’. The travel urge for young New Zealanders has not diminished - unfortunately many are not returning. How good would it be for the young to have formed good habits of, health, wealth, and relationships through one's 20s as opposed to more questionable behaviours and early ‘bad habits’? What a difference to the rest of their life! Good habits don’t stop having fun.During age increases through the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s multiple life experiences and changes occur – and living seems to move faster as one progresses. It is not too late to start planning through any of these life stages – to align the products and services necessary with one’s goals, aspirations, or intentions. Banking, investing, insuring, estate management – with short-, medium-, and long-term goals. Anything well-planned and implemented at age 50 or 60 is a whole lot better than doing nothing. Taking advice at life stages can have a two-pronged positive influence – it may assist in making smarter financial decisions and give clarity to direction, but it may also prevent or lessen dumb ones.It is incredibly hard for people to progress through life and the various life stages, without help/advice, whether medical, financial, or personal. For many of the ‘events’ through the various stages, it is too late to recapture the opportunity or to prevent the occurrence which happened in the stage previous. However, whilst many people can move on from regret, there is inevitably a cost – either financial mental or physical, but there is also an opportunity to; review one’s position, clarify intentions, measure, reset aspirations, and step forward with renewed optimism. After all most of NZ's small businesses, the self-employed, farmers, and corporates must do this on an ongoing basis. They have a plan (strategy) a constitution (the rules of the business) a board or mentor (external advice) and they revisit these intentions, regularly measuring execution and results on an ongoing basis. So too, successful sporting teams and athletes of all persuasions. Why don’t individuals or families do it? - that’s FoxPlan's opportunity.From these learnings was formed a business – did it start as a complete package for people of all ages, no. But it has evolved and now delivers to a cross-section of New Zealanders, many of whom are considerably better off from having visited with our company and/or our advisers – whether specialist or generalist. We intend to progress indefinitely, to do so, succession and continuity are important for clients, FoxPlan personnel, and suppliers. We are constantly on the lookout for new personnel to teach and train and new clients to advise and service. We plan for a multigenerational contribution to our community – and a strong desire to deliver with a moral compass. Our Board, our shareholders, our constitution, and our staff, are committed to continuity for the business – not single generational profit and short-term payoffs. In other words, we intend to walk the talk of; long-term planning, holistic aspirations, professional execution and service, and client centricity. We are only in the early ‘stages’ of the life cycle – there are many decades yet to come.",,"Wed, 20 Dec 2023 23:03:07 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
"Wealth Series, Part 2: What’s your number? How much is enough? (Copy)",,"“A wealthy person has a significant net worth and passive income sources, making their financial future secure”. It’s an important starting point – to know your goal. And for the purpose of interest – the goal is applicable, across all age ranges and at all lifestages. The only intelligent progression in the creation of net worth and passive income sources is; therefore, the goal (or goals), next the plan for achieving the goal(s), and only then the portfolio. The assumption is, an investment portfolio based on the major investment asset classes, of equities, commercial property, bonds, and cash.For simplicity’s sake, I have assumed that the majority of people reading this article and the ‘wealth’ series are not likely to be SMEs, farmers, or tradies. Although at some point, you may have accumulated /invested, inherited, or created your wealth, there will come a time when a ‘portfolio’ becomes the major vehicle for the maintenance, enhancement, or facilitation of your plan – and the most effective means by which you can transfer that wealth to the next generation.Therefore, sticking with the premise of ‘part #1.’ In this series (ie the light coming on at age 52)You are a 52-year-old couple whose goal is to retire in 10 years at age 62. We’ve determined that at that time, you will want to withdraw from investments in inflation-adjusted dollars the equivalent of $75,000 today, over and above your anticipated NZ Government superannuation (currently available at age 65). In other words, you’ll need to withdraw at trendline inflation approximately $100,000 a year starting in 10 years (your KiwiSaver is currently not available for withdrawal until age 65)You would like to maintain your wealth for multi-generational benefit and thus maintain the capital if possible – your legacy going to grandchildren and philanthropy. Assuming (a) your good health has been maintained (b) you have not made poor decisions around property (c) the cost of living/surviving has not escalated by way of retirement village costs etc, etc, etc.We’ve agreed at retirement you’ll want to have two years of living expenses (or about $200,000) put aside in a money market fund, as a reserve for contingencies.We further agree on a first-year withdrawal rate of 4.5% per year, with the cash withdrawal escalating at 3% per year to offset inflation in your living costs (we are using 3% as the trendline for inflation – as experienced on average over the last 100 years)Specifically, to fully fund this plan you’ll need to accumulate $2.4 to $2.5 million in the next 10 years. That breaks down as (a) roughly $2.2 million to generate your $100,000 withdrawal assuming the 4.5% rate, plus (b) $200,000 more in reserve.You currently have (x) in retirement funds accumulated via managed funds in at-work super (available at age 62) and KiwiSaver (available at age 65) and have committed to invest an additional (y) dollars in each of the 120 months until your projected retirement date. Based on those assumptions, you will need (example) an 8.7% compound return to reach your goal in 10 years.Historically, a rate of return that high has only been achievable in equities/shares. We have selected a diversified equity fund / ETF portfolio, composed of (large cap/small cap/international/emerging markets) whose historical long-term return (net of our adviser fees at FoxPlan) has been 10%.There can of course be no assurance of your achieving that return over the next 10 years. If you do not, adjustments may have to be made in terms of your investing more as you accumulate or working through for example, to age 65 (when your KiwiSaver becomes available), or scaling back your withdrawals in the early years of your retirement.Equities subject your return and your capital to very wide variances. For example, the Standard and Poor's 500 – share/equity index has declined 14% annually on average since 1980. It has declined by an average of a third, once every 5/6 years. However, the closing price of the index in 1971 (the year you were born) was 98. Today it is over 4,000 (not considering dividends) Declines are temporary and time progressively leaches them out for the patient, disciplined investor.We’ve agreed that our investment policy will be to continue investing as planned through any and all of the declines we may encounter over the next 10 years, in the hope of acquiring relatively lower-priced shares. Again, there can be no assurance that such a strategy will succeed.We’ve agreed that we will review this strategy no less than annually, but that provided your goals do not change in the interim, we do not expect to alter materially either your plan or your portfolio. By way of clarification – the writer has been assisting or providing direct financial planning and investment advice since before 1987. A date imprinted in many NZs' minds as a consequence of ‘the crash’! It is important to differentiate between ‘the stock market’ (what crashes and burns or shoots the lights out) which is a behavioural measure of investor emotion or mood swings as they react to media catastrophism – and the top 500 companies of the world. The managers of those top 500 companies are directly responsible to their boards and their shareholders – their capability, knowledge, and skill determine both personal and business outcomes – and unlike politicians, it is measured and reported regularly. They innovate, adapt, transition, pivot, and always focus on both short- and long-term strategies – and, weigh up risk. In 1987 the S&P 500 (the top 500 companies in the US) (I always use this as the proxy for a managed fund portfolio of shares) – troughed at 223. Since then, a further eight 20% + declines have occurred. But as mentioned earlier, declines are temporary, and the growth of these companies is permanent (at the time of writing the S&P is 4,300)Why is it so important to escalate the message around equities? – because it is seldom taught, most often denigrated inappropriately, poorly reported on by the media, and misunderstood even within the financial planning industry itself – to such a level that clients are led to misunderstand what the real risks are. The real risk in investment (using managed funds) is not volatility – but not knowing your goal, not understanding how to measure your required actions/inputs/criteria, and not understanding the only asset that is likely to get you to achieve your ultimate outcome. Summarily – I hope it is clear that your goal will determine your number (how big a bag of money you need) the plan will determine how you reach it (the analysis, products, expectations) the portfolio the means by which we determine, what assets to use and why – and the review process held to hold each of the parties accountable to agreed decisions. It’s called lifestage planning. Next week – Part 3. Principles and Practices of Successful Investment.",,"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 20:23:27 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz

At what age the switch goes on and enlightens the former non-believers or the disinterested, the various myths and misconceptions which cloud an investor's mind, and the common mistakes people make when it comes to attaining financial peace of mind? Let’s clarify wealth – what is the difference between rich and wealthy? A rich person may have a significant income but may not have accumulated assets, leading to a less sustainable financial situation. On the other hand, a wealthy individual has a significant net worth and passive income sources, making their financial future more secure. This series is about ‘Wealth’ and some important understandings about why, how, and what Statistics tell us that you are likely to be ‘retired’ for a third of your life Tax will be the largest outgoing over a lifetime Your home will likely cost you double what the purchase price was If you have a health or employment hiccup through the accumulation years – you need to mitigate the risk (use a % age of income as your guide to cost the solution) What size bag of money you require and how much risk mitigation is ‘enough’ are important questions for regular review So, we have a basis for the Wealth series Living life on ‘purpose’ – life is for living What’s your number? – how much is enough when income stops (for whatever reason) Principles and practices – of successful investing Why do I need advice? – the 8 great investment mistakes, and types of risks Where’s the best place to start? – product, portfolio, property, self-employment What are the likely lifestages I need to consider? – is an old people's home the destination? Some statistics that might surprise you – and can I handle the facts? Part 1. Living life on purpose It never fails to amaze me why young people become ‘Max Verstappen-like’ when they get their cars onto the beach at Peka Peka or Foxton. What is the urge, and motivation to drive in tight circles – in the sand? Why would they even go near the saltwater in their cars – but they do. Then there’s the young guys that ram raid. The car this time is a weapon – the one on the beach, some kind of reverie. Thrill seekers or hooligans. I suspect the latter will never become clients of our company – their behaviour points to a different sort of attitude/habit of thought. But what about those whose values match the market demographic for a company like FoxPlan – do their habits determine critical aspects of life? Sure do! Can they change – we shall see. What we know about people and money is that at about age 52, a switch ignites a financial reality check. At 51 their priorities revolved around ‘the Teslar’ or ‘the trip to Tahiti’ or ‘the Taupo bach’. At 52 it’s a Keto diet, enough money to chase the kids across the world, buy a campervan and/or continue to live an uninterrupted lifestyle. Suddenly the light goes on – and ‘How much is enough’ they quietly request. Well, you may not have left it too late by age 52 to have made the final journey to and through retirement – or corrected your diet, and exercise programme in time to walk the streets of Rome or the Peruvian Inca centre of worship at Machu Picchu. In fact, you may have already done your travel thing by then and now you want to grow tomatoes and make wooden toys! So be it. I’m a fan of people living life on purpose – their purpose. Life is for living and enjoying but I know from personal experience and experience gained from 25 years plus of giving lifestage planning advice that the destination and the journey can be enhanced with attention to aspects of – Health, Money, and Relationships. In fact, FoxPlan's basic premise, its original purpose was to address holistic lifestage planning – for people of all ages. Planning for a purposeful life. Of course, as our senior adviser team became more senior, the emphasis moved to some degree from; lending to leverage, from kids to campervans, from restaurants to retirement villages, from employment to enduring powers of attorney. That is why the company has continued to focus on recruitment and training – for staff and advisers. The future of our company, our community, and our country, depends on the treatment of its people. As a company we have a responsibility to ensure our clients from yesteryear are as financially secure and well set up for the last third of their life as we could possibly manage – and for that to be achieved, the company’s continuity plan necessitates an ongoing structure of support – and standards. New people, new technology, new procedures and systems, with old school standards of trustworthiness and authenticity. In other words – we have walked the talk. 25 years ago, we knew that for the company to keep its ‘promise’ to its clients there would need to be a changing of the guard, a changing of the guardhouse, and an investment for the future into technology and people. No different to how we intentionally suggest to our clients, be they business owners, self-employed, managers, administrators, professionals, mums, and dads – planning and structure, goals and aspirations, intentions, and direction, will assist longevity and lifestyle. Wealth is not simply about how much we earn – it is much more than that. The wealth of the nation just like the wealth of a company, or a family is founded on trustworthiness – the six principles of which have been the foundation for FoxPlan over the past 25 years. And how about habits and behaviour – can the ‘young’ beach car enthusiast convert? Well, I haven’t exactly lived the last 70+ years as a monk – I remember Foxton Beach very well! Making smarter decisions helps – and everyone needs the opportunity – having someone to walk hand in hand with me was my smartest decision.

The people and planning (six concepts) start to develop a broader concept of seeking ‘Wealth’ outcomes through various product and portfolio designs. 3 PrinciplesFaith Faith in there being a future, based on a system of economic science ie capitalism – you either trust that system and subscribe to an investment portfolio based on its continuation in something similar to its current format, or you do not. Vote #1.Patience The future price of shares of consistently superior businesses are a direct function of their future earnings, dividends, and cash flows – history is our only certainty, we know the consistent growth of superior businesses because it has been measured for the last 100 years) You either subscribe to the belief that the upward trend of successful businesses has always bounced back from temporary declining markets, or you do not. Vote #2.Discipline Markets are volatile because people are emotional, and they react – most often poorly) You understand that price and value are inversely related and thus continue to invest when markets decline in price, or you do not. Vote #3. Of course, it is the responsibility of a ‘good’ financial adviser to advise, support, educate, and communicate (more in-depth) in the premise of these principles – anyone who values your business would be obliged to do so. 3 PracticesAsset allocation What %age is in shares, what %age is in commercial property – ie growth assets, what %age is in bonds, what %age is in cash – ie fixed income assets Diversification The global spread of products within each asset class – ie not only one company, not only one country, and not only one asset type within each ie small company shares, value company shares, large company shares, growth company shares – bonds with variable terms, and variable risk. Re-balancing Reviewing annually to ensure portfolio structure matches the original plan and if through any particular reason, it does not – subscribing to a reasoned process of restructure ie just as any intelligent business owner would and does of necessity adapt, adjust to market disruption, so too the intelligent investor. That does not necessarily mean a change to asset allocation (unless the plan changes – see part 4 of the 3 Planning functions). The financial and lifestage planner is of necessity for both an educator and a behavioural counsellor. Most poor financial and lifestage decisions are made from an emotional reaction and seldom include professional advice. 3 People DecisionsAdvice vs DIY People seldom consider that the timeframe of investment and lifestage planning could be over 60 years and possibly inter-generational – and therefore making consistently good decisions and maintaining disciplines over this period is likely to be beyond them – especially if investing is not their ‘go’. Product vs Planning using fund managers Most DIY investors think ‘return’ first, and most professional financial advisers think ‘risk’ first – investing is not gambling or speculating. Planning does not start with product consideration; it starts with having a mutually determined set of outcomes and having a plan of how they may be best accomplished. Active vs Passive fund management Both are available and optional with most financial advisers – but one costs less than the other and, in most circumstances, outperforms over the long term – FoxPlan primarily focuses on passive funds management and uses external professionals for both investment management and compliant administration – and an administrative platform for online availability 24/7. Property and term deposits were the primary investment considerations for individual personal investors in NZ when this author entered the finance industry in 1967. Banks seldom provided individual residential mortgage finance – that domain existed primarily with solicitors and building societies. The trend has remained, however – (apart from solicitors’ ‘trust’ funds) – NZs love property, but it has now created imbalance and unaffordability for many first-home buyers (if they don’t have family to assist with capital or security). Politicians will inevitably address this anomaly. 3 Planning DecisionsCash management Assuming that the investor considers a plan to be superior to a product the lifestage planner has three important compartments to fill, advise, and recommend – they being first, income and expenditure and cash reserves (cash mgt), secondly, an investment portfolio which becomes the servant of the plan, and third, risk management which is the safety net of products which protect the client's accumulation phase and ultimate plan outcomes. Investment Portfolio The structure and framework of investments necessary to achieve the investor's best possible means of achieving their investment and lifestage goals commensurate with their chosen lifestyle and attitude to risk – this may include their own business, KiwiSaver and managed funds, direct shares or fixed interest, direct property. This is about the linking of strategy and product with short-, medium-, and long-term goals. Risk management Asset insurance, personal/family insurance, estate management, business key person and business risk – are products used for this purpose – and any investment product decision should have addressed potential risks in alignment with acceptance and awareness of possible consequences (both conservative and aggressive). After many years of providing lifestage planning and investment advice to clients, it is with much pride and a positive conscience that I pass the baton onto our younger group of financial advisers – whilst they may not possess the 50 years of experience and accompanying market dynamic they have been chosen, trained and educated with the same dedication to morality, service, and professionalism with which the company has maintained its reputation and authenticity over the past 27 years. Next week, the 8 great investment mistakes and what the real risks are.",,"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 20:23:06 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
"Wealth Series, Part 4: Risks and Common Mistakes (Copy)",,"What the real risks are, and the predominant mistakes investors makeAll successful investing is goal-oriented and therefore planning-driven.All unsuccessful investing is market-oriented and therefore performance-driven.I introduce part 4. of the wealth series with this statement because by far the primary risk investors make is either having no plan or building a plan based on misinformation. Numerous risks eventuate due to these two scenarios. Whilst I can’t guarantee that having a goal-based investment plan will ensure the desired outcome, I can guarantee that having no goal or basing the goal on misinformation could inevitably turn to disappointment. Property (residential investment property) and term deposits are two good examples. NZs have historically placed much credence on both – as have I. However, neither is riskless. Investment into residential property is usually dependent upon leverage – using one’s home as a means of borrowing. Using equity from the home to do so. Many market adjustments can affect possible positive outcomes, such as; rising interest rates, reducing asset values, legislative changes, and personal circumstances (income, health, children, employment) Term deposits are ‘cash’ investments – and cash deposits do not exceed inflation over time. Retirees are usually cash investors – they focus on retention of capital as opposed to retention of purchasing power, and thus inevitably need to use capital if they wish to retain their lifestyle. (erosion of purchasing power over 20 years – 3% inflation 46% decline, 4% inflation 65% decline, 7% inflation 77% decline)Just a couple examples of not bad options – if circumstances are appropriate but disastrous if they are not – both residential property and term deposits are useful planning products for an overall plan – but taken on their own or without pre-determined rationale, are likely to have short- or long-term negative ramifications. And there are alternatives which could have been better options.There are eight major investment mistakes, and we have just discussed two. Leverage (using one’s home and equity to borrow and purchase an investment into residential property) and focusing only on yield (interest on term deposits) and ignoring total return (growth assets – such as equities, which provide both yield and capital growth)The next two are important investment fundamentals – but damaging if used inappropriately, they being diversification. Over diversification (owning everything in a sub-optimal way ie multiple fund managers) and under diversification (the narrowing of a portfolio into an idea (tech stocks/investment property).Euphoria (greed) and Fear (panic) are peas out of the same pod. People who are euphoric ignore the idea that principal loss is possible (investing is not gambling or speculating) People who are fearful are at the opposite end of the cycle from euphoria but often mistake volatility for loss – and thus focus totally on yield (which they believe often mistakenly that retention of principal is the key goal – and it is not if retirement and retention of lifestyle are the goals. (Often retirees commence their retirement hoping to pass on their capital to their heirs – and thus choose term deposits) With inflation and taxation exceeding interest rates, the next generation needs to start from scratch because Mum and Dad blew the lump sum from their investments, not from expenditure, but due to poor planning and poor asset allocation.The final two investment mistakes I have encountered over my time as an adviser are; people speculating when they think they are investing (gold, currencies, crypto) and investors making portfolio decisions based on a cost basis (fees/taxes) or media speculation (influence from external source, even family) When people chase price trends they are traders – and traders are speculators (investors chase value, speculators chase price) The advisers role is primarily focused to these individual or combination of issues – how to convince the investor that unless the ‘plan’ changes, the portfolio should be retained. And of course, educating why, through the process.There is one inviolable decision when investing – the age of assets you place in ‘riskless’ investments (allegedly) versus what age will you place in the ‘great companies’ of the world. Owning versus loaning. Equities versus fixed interest. The greater the age you own the greater the companies of the world, and the greater the probability you will outperform your sustainable lifestyle. This is a statement of historical fact. (long-term return) Equities have a record of outperforming inflation by 3 to 4 times. Losing principal over a 30-year term in a diversified fund of international equities has never occurred in any 30-year term in history – including the depression and the 14 bear markets since World War 2. Growth investments are not the problem but a very viable solution.Next week Part 5. ‘Where’s the best place to start’",,"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 20:19:05 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
"Wealth Series, Part 5: Where’s the best place to start? (Copy)",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1701896085834-Y9U41R3PER87A4CRK4ZG/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"In part #1 of this wealth series we suggested ‘planning’ as being a starting point for investors and people in general – ‘to live life on purpose’ – your purpose. A plan to align intentions, aspirations, and pre-determined outcomes with the products and services necessary to put in place both the journey (lifestyle, health, wealth, relationships) with the products (savings, investments, insurances), services (business structure, tax, accounting, legal, financial advisory), and behaviours (disciplines, patience, attitudes, emotions), necessary to achieve them. Easier said than done – especially in a disruptive; weather, social, economic, political, religious, technological, legal, and patriotic/war-like world. Our mental health statistics portray the result of such stress and pressures and our medicated society attempts to manage them. In years past the family unit and/or a religious framework became the fallback position for structure and support. Not always successful. Today however the number of everyday NZs either medicated for stress and depression or institutionalised is dramatically greater than 50 years ago. Society is paying a price for a freer way of life – one where responsibility for oneself is proving beyond many. We advocate using professionals to assist – whether for health, relationships, money, or business. Our farmers were once the bastion of our society – today their mental health issues and sad outcomes match the rest of society. Everyone can benefit from a mentor – including the best sporting teams. Seek out good advice and stick with it – don’t enrol for six months and let the disciplines slip. In part #2 we moved from the general planning topic to the specifics of pre-determining how much income you needed to plan for at the point in time you wanted to finish work. In other words, ‘how much is enough’? Historically most NZs relied on government superannuation. Thankfully this changed 17 years ago when the then-Labour government introduced two meaningful pieces of legislation – an NZ super capital accumulation fund, and KiwiSaver. One to underpin the current national super fund to ensure its continuity and usefulness and the other to create an opportunity for every at-work New Zealander to accumulate with their employer's help into an individually chosen accumulation fund. Both have assisted with the financial education of NZs and their likelihood for an improved retirement lifestyle through the growth of their own lump sum. But as a financial advisory practice, we know that it is important for people to understand what the real risks are – either outliving your retirement funds and maintaining purchasing power or not having enough in the first place to either stop work or retain lifestyle. For many people and for any number of reasons – KiwiSaver and govt super will not be enough. A recommendation then - get some ‘retirement’ advice. In part #3 we specified what we believe to be the most appropriate ‘principles and practices’ for investors, financial planners, and lifestylers, to undertake when considering their future. A framework for implementing recommended actions and measuring through managed feedback (at least annually) from trusted mentors. Two weeks ago (part #4) we covered – ‘what the major mistakes are’ that investors make throughout their lifetime. It is important to know these ‘mistakes’ sooner rather than later because with investing time cannot be recovered and so much of the success in accumulating wealth takes time. When it comes to maintaining wealth – it is also important to know the ‘mistakes’ because most often people underestimate the necessity for a 30-year timeframe in retirement, and the dramatic effect of inflation – hence they ‘go for safety’. If maintaining both capital and lifestyle is important – then income products (such as term deposits, cash funds, and bonds) will not likely provide the long-term answer. Today (part #5) Where’s the best place to start – we refer here to any age or position within ‘lifestages’ – is it; buying property for living or lifestyle or both, relying on KiwiSaver, accumulating in managed funds, starting/building/growing a business, self-employment, buying shares/bonds/term deposits, managing a budget, paying off a mortgage, being DIY vs taking advice. Most people who have money for investment either through; inheritance, accumulation through at-work super and/or KiwiSaver, business sale, farm sale, sale of property, or winnings – do not have the knowledge or the wherewithal to successfully grow or maintain their money ongoing. Whilst they have created a good sum through their personal attributes and hard work, when it comes to the different disciplines applicable for investment, there is a capability gap. It is frustrating to be introduced to this – too late! As we have previously mentioned, managing 30 years of accumulation, and maintaining capital in investment funds for another 30 years is beyond most people. Especially if their behaviours are the same or like most other people who are not in the financial services industry. The cost of advice vs the adverse short- and long-term potential downsides is considerable. Most of our current financial planning clients would reinforce the recommendation to ‘start now’ vs ‘thinking about’ – in fact in my time as an adviser working directly with clients at all stages of their lives – the most common statement was – ‘I wish I had started down this track of planning and taking investment advice a lot earlier’ What I would say is ‘it is never too late’ – for both peace of mind and the legacy for the next generations. Most actions (especially investment) are best determined and implemented – through planning, not from buying products or simply paying into products and expecting a maximised outcome.",,"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 20:18:43 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
"Wealth Series, Part 7 – The Final Part. (Copy)",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1704317128273-ZKEQS6MWEDZUIDB80FU7/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"‘Some statistics might surprise you’The greater the % you own of the great companies of the world, the greater the probability you will outperform your sustainable lifestyle (pre-supposing that your investment strategy was premised on maintaining your lifestyle after you have finished your employment and your work-related income stops). Equities (the great companies of the world) have a record of outperforming inflation by 3 to 4 times. On the other hand, fixed-income investments (bonds and cash) have been most likely to outperform inflation by only 1 – 2%pa, over the long term. Therefore, when you take tax into account, fixed income investments may seem like a safe option in the short term, when over the longer term (a 30-year timeframe – a third of your life) you will need to use your invested capital simply to maintain your standard of living. (ie cashing in deposits to put into your bank account for daily living or unexpected capital requirements) And in my experience, this becomes a stressful and slow but debilitating emotional roller coaster for retirees, and removes or reduces any chance for multi-generational wealth (ie passing on your investments to your children or grandchildren) I know why generations do it – but if only they would take advice or better educate on financial basics. Losing principal in a well-diversified international equity portfolio over any 30-year term in history (predominantly US) – including the depression has never occurred. Growth investments are not the problem – but the only solution. But the reality is that the measure by which most people consider their accumulating investments in equities (including KiwiSaver) – is a daily stock market commentary and a negative media ongoing narrative. Investors become traumatised. The stock market is not a reflection of company performance. It is a reflection of ‘investors’ expectations, past and future – two very different things.There was minimal media euphoria when global small companies earned 35% in 2013, value companies 30% and large companies 28%.Or exaltation in 2014 with global property at 28%, NZ large companies at 18%, and global large at 9%.Or celebration in 2015 with global small 16%, global property 14%, global large 14%.Or High fives in 2016 with Aust value stocks being 26%, emerging markets stocks at 16%, and NZ small 13%.Or Party time in 2017 with emerging markets at 30%, Aus small at 23%, NZ large at 22%Or congrats to NZ large stocks for maintaining 5% in a tough environment in 2018, when NZ govt bonds did 5%, and fixed interest 2%. No headlines on that performance.What about 2019, with NZ large doing 30%, global large 27%, global small 25%And 2020, NZ small at 24%, NZ large at 14%, Aus small at 12%And 2021, global property 39%, global value 30%, global large 29%And 2022 Aus value was 9%, global value 4%, Aus large 2% (and NZ 90-day bills did 2% and fixed interest did minus -5.82%.) For the last 10 years, these were the top three performing assets – for the year. And in case you may have missed much of the last decade – some unusually traumatic events occurred both in NZ and around the world – the same world in which the great companies bought and sold their products.I wish to make a point with statistics, not to obfuscate but to bring your attention to why many people in NZ create wealth in one generation and then spend it in their lifetime, usually inefficiently. (Not that I decry their right) But to do so due to poor financial decision-making, exacerbated by the inevitable costs associated with ill health, a booming inflation (and therefore cost of living) and unexpected events, could have been better applied. The stress related to the drain on capital from (home maintenance, car replacement, family issues/support etc, etc) combined with aging and emotional impacts from world geopolitical activities, and medical misadventures (Wuhan and mandates) can accumulate and take its toll. Money worries become more and more pronounced whether real or imagined – people can and do become hugely disaffected. Good advice and having peace of mind is useful.In the last 27 years, the S&P 500 (the top 50 companies in the US) and the index (the valuation of its companies) have grown from 459 to over 4,000 – and most importantly its dividends which are not included in the index (ie what the companies pay out to their investors) has had a 350% gain – whilst inflation over the same period, a 64% gain. So purely based on dividend payout with tax paid outside of the funds under management – dividends are growing at a much greater rate than inflation. No media exposure of this. But every year when the ‘stock market’ does a nosedive and it does so regularly – the media are catastrophists. You would be led to believe that all the companies were now no longer great companies – but were suddenly worth 20% less (this has happened 14 X in my lifetime) But declines are always temporary and gains, permanent. Volatility is not loss. Price and value are inversely related.Investing in the great companies of the world, begs the question. How do companies prosper when the country in which they have started or predominantly grown, seems to continually run budget deficits, and/or grow weakly? And secondly, if the world stock markets (great companies) continue to prosper geographically in Western countries (predominantly capitalist) what role does a financial adviser play in addressing/educating their client?If you are at least 50 years old today, you have lived through three episodes where the broad market halved. Yet in these 50 years, leading companies (especially American companies) have prospered as never before. And why? Because successful companies use periods of adversity to become even better in the long term. The facts support that – valuations are transparent, and dividends are real and measurable. (in the next series I’ll explain how)If you have been offering financial planning and advice to people for 50 years (like I have) you know that not every potential client will trust your advice and knowledge. I didn’t attempt to convince those who didn’t wish to follow my advice – life is too short. An adviser should not need to ‘sell’, insurance, planning, investments, or lending. I have always believed that if the professional/tradie I was about to hire for advice/service could show me what how and why – then I would trust but verify. That does not mean that an adviser should be trusted without a solid reason for doing so – does the report/recommendation stack up to expectations, was the insight and resource appropriately determined, does the adviser simply wish to transact or maintain a long-term relationship – where outcomes are measured and adjustments suggested, does the fee seem to be commensurate with the value, are the reviews based on fact and position to manage and in alignment with client aspiration.The basis for much of the ‘wealth’ series has been focused on managed funds – for a reason. Most of the accumulation occurs in NZ over time and in managed funds. It is effective and measurable; however, it is not the only way. Wealth is also created in NZ via self-employment, business, farming, and property – however in most instances whatever method was used to create the wealth is not the same method used to maintain it. Managed funds are – hence the importance of managed funds, to both accumulate and maintain.",,"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 20:17:50 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
Welcome To The 2019/20 Financial Year,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579609614013-ZSI2CVOPGHICDP2OAZT3/Welcome+To+The+201920+Financial+Year.jpg?format=original,"The first of April brings with it a new financial year for New Zealanders so this week we thought we would cover the major changes around Taxation and KiwiSaver that kick in from 1 April 2019.Tax Refunds and ScamsThe IRD have made income tax refunds automatic for most taxpayers from 1 April 2019. If the IRD has your details on file your tax refund will be paid automatically between late May and July. If you have used automatic tax agent services previously your refund may still be paid to them instead so now is a good time to check your tax and contact information with the IRD.With this change it’s also important to be on the lookout for tax refund scams. The IRD has already reported two separate phishing email scams being sent out this year. The IRD will never provide your tax refund amount in an email, will always redirect you to myIR for any personal/sensitive information and will never demand payments through gift cards.Finally, if you’re receiving automatic refunds but have income protection and/or some other personal insurance policies in place, we strongly recommend getting in touch with an accountant as these may be tax deductible and will likely not be covered in your automatic refund.KiwiSaverOn the KiwiSaver front the new financial year brings in 6% and 10% contribution rates for savers – in addition to the existing 3%, 4% and 8% options. These rates should help KiwiSavers ramp up their retirement savings at a more gradual pace as the previous jump from 4% to 8% for many was too far, too fast.For those over 65, you can now opt in to KiwiSaver if you are still working as well. Employers can choose to make contributions in addition and the requirement that new KiwiSaver members over 60 remain in KiwiSaver for at least 5 years before withdrawing funds has also been removed.These changes bring increased flexibility to the scheme and will help New Zealanders of all generations better prepare for their retirement.Looking ForwardWhilst things remain relatively calm for the 2019/20 FY, there is a strong chance we will see a number of changes to the taxation system including Capital Gains in the near future. Working with a dedicated accountant early can help minimize the disruption these changes will have on your own tax affairs.The team at FoxPlan Accounting and Wealth Management are more than happy to have a chat about tax affairs as well as how your accounting can be aligned to your business goals.

What changes to tax ring-fencing mean for landlords,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579468655774-Q7GLITPMH20ZSB4HB30N/What%2Bchanges%2Bto%2Btax%2Bring-fencing%2Bmean%2Bfor%2Blandlords.jpg?format=original,"A few weeks ago, we touched on whether now is a good time to invest in property with changes around insulation requirements and tax law (the short answer – it depends on your personal circumstances). This week we delve further into the detail of the tax changes that affect all investment property owners as of the 1st of April 2019.The legislation changesOn the 26th of June this year the “Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019” came into force. This piece of legislation covers many areas relating to taxation including changes to rental property ring-fencing which have broadly flown under the radar of most property investors.Prior to this act, if a landlord operated a rental property at a loss, they were able to offset that loss against their personal income tax - which generally resulted in an income tax refund. This often occurred when the costs of a mortgage, rates and insurance exceeded the income generated through rent. With the changes made in the act, this loss can no longer be deducted against personal income and must be carried forward to a year when the property makes a profit to gain any tax benefit.With this change, the rental cashflow of landlords will no doubt take a hit. Historically, the refund has been an important source of funds to cover significant costs such as insurance and rates. Without this refund these costs will need to be paid from existing cashflow upfront and could have potential knock on effects as quarterly and monthly insurance premiums incur higher costs than those paid annually.3 Strategies landlords can use to respondWe’ve spoken with Andrew Nicol from Opes Partners about the strategies that landlords can use to respond to these changes. He suggested a three-pronged approach:1) Refinance your mortgage to cut costs – The most significant expense of any investment property is its mortgage. Interest rates have fallen significantly over recent years. You may be able to refinance your mortgage to a better rate or switch from a principal and interest loan to an interest-only loan. Implementing this strategy should decrease your costs.2) Purchase a positively geared property – A legitimate approach to respond to the ring-fencing changes is searching for higher income. That does not necessarily need to be within the properties you already own. If you were to purchase a property that has a surplus each week, you could then use that surplus to offset the increased costs you are now facing in your existing investments. If you would like more info on the differences between the different types of properties (and what kind of property might fit these criteria), check out Opes’ Epic Guide to Property Investment in NZ.3) Increase rent – The other potential source of additional income is rent. When Australian lawmakers passed ringfencing legislation over a decade ago, landlords increased rents by 25% in 2 years. Seeing this, MPs repealed the law. This legislation makes it more costly to be a landlord, so, naturally, some of these costs will be passed on to tenants. Talk to your property manager to see whether there is any scope in your local market to increase rent.Bonus strategy: Talk to your accountant to get personalised advice for your situation.Moving forward with the changesAcross parliament there have been movements by both sides of politics which mean investment property ownership is increasingly being treated similarly to running a business rather than a source of additional personal income. Higher rental standards, increased scrutiny for Property Managers and these tax changes demonstrate that this trend is unlikely to change.With this change in regulation it may mean that landlords need to take a more in-depth review of their finances and work with an Accountant to plan cashflow - as well as ensure that they are tax compliant and maximizing potential benefits.Our team at FoxPlan Accounting & Wealth Management are more than happy to have a chat with you around investment property.

What does retirement actually cost?,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/3f6fa58d-ccfd-450c-9557-cc84946619ae/1699562647109.png?format=original,"It's official - New Zealand Super will not be enough in retirement. Not really a new, or groundbreaking statement. On this episode of our podcast, one of the topics we covered was the latest findings from the Massey 2023 Retirement Expenditure Guidelines. The rising cost of living continues to be an issue, and the report shows the clear importance of saving and investing for your retirement. So what does retirement actually cost, and what's the gap between what the government provides and what you need?The below table shows a number of scenarios and allows us to compare one-person households to two-person households, as well as compare the major cities (metro) to the provinces (provincial). It also shows the difference between a no-frills lifestyle, and a choices lifestyle, which relates to the standard of living you can expect in retirement. If you're reading this newsletter and listening to our podcast, it's probably fair to assume you're aiming for a choices retirement for yourself and your family. The New Zealand Retirement Expenditure Guidelines as at 30th June 2023Clearly there is a gap between what you can expect from the government, and what you will likely need. Even the no-frills two-person provisional budget falls almost $5,000 per year year short. On the other end of the spectrum, a choices two-person metro budget falls $46,915 per year short. That's a relatively decent gap to fill, especially if you consider the potential for a 30-year retirement, medical costs, and ongoing care at some point. Another thing to keep in mind is that this is in today's dollars and based on the rules and legislation in effect today. How confident are we that NZ Super will still look like this in the future with an aging population and fewer taxpayers putting into the money pool? I for one don't want to leave my retirement needs in the hands of any government.",,"Tue, 28 Nov 2023 00:21:00 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
What does the RTA Amendment Bill mean for Landlords?,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579458727954-20807KNKFGJOFAMZKW4V/What%2Bdoes%2Bthe%2BRTA%2BAmendment%2BBill%2Bmean%2Bfor%2BLandlords.jpg?format=original,"In 2016, an odd ruling came through the Court of Appeal (CoA) in New Zealand. The court found that two Auckland tenants who had left a pot of oil on high heat unattended (which resulted in the property suffering a major fire) were not liable for any of the costs of damage due to the unintentional nature of their actions.It has taken some time, but as a result of the CoA ruling, the government has just passed the Residential Tenancies Act (RTA) Amendment Bill #2. This week we look at what the changes in the bill mean for your investment property.What are Tenants responsible for?With the CoA ruling, tenants were essentially not responsible for any damage except anything that was intentionally caused. The RTA Amendment Bill now brings back the responsibilities of tenants, even where damage is unintentional.If the careless actions of a tenant cause damage, they will now be responsible for paying either four weeks rent or the insurance excess (whichever is lesser) to the landlord for repairs.What do Landlords have to do?As of 27 August 2019, all tenancy agreements must include an Insurance Clause. Failure to include this clause can result in a $500 penalty per tenancy against the landlord.This clause must state whether:1) The Property is insured;2) If yes, if there is an insurance excess; and3) The dollar value of the excessIt’s important to note for #2 that there may multiple excesses that apply to your insurance policies – these must all be listed on the agreement.If you have a Property Manager already looking after your investment property, they should have been in contact to request your insurance information (if they don’t already have this on file).Need a review?If you’re not sure about the current excesses in place for your investment property or whether it is adequately insured, we would be more than happy to provide a free review for you.Please feel free to email info@foxplan.nz and one of our advisers will be in touch.

What would negative interest rates mean for you?,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579458396218-2D8WUYIQF577ZWE4TQDV/What%2Bwould%2Bnegative%2Binterest%2Brates%2Bmean%2Bfor%2Byou.jpg?format=original,"A few weeks ago, Dean spoke on Free Advice Friday about the limits on cash transactions governments across the world are starting to put in place and some of the rationale behind it.This week we are digging into the detail to ask just what might happen in a world with negative interest rates.Negative interest ratesIn ‘normal’ circumstances, we would expect to see higher interest rates in an economy with strong wage growth and low unemployment. Whilst the global economy has rebounded from the lows of the Global Financial Crisis in 2008/09, things aren’t exactly back to ‘normal’. Across the US, Australia, New Zealand and other developed nations, interest rates remain low - the cost of borrowing is still very cheap.This has got bodies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) worried. The ability for central banks to cut interest rates during economic downturns is one of their biggest tools and there is now little room to move if times get harder.The concern now is, if there is another major economic downturn – will central banks have to consider negative interest rates?The implicationsWhat would negative interest rates mean for you? Firstly, keeping your money in the bank would cost you. Instead of gaining interest on your savings each month, you’d be paying the bank just to keep it there (whilst it loses value).Logically in such a scenario we would see a run on banks with everyone withdrawing their cash. This is where law changes such as what is being proposed in Australia comes into play. By limiting cash transactions to a maximum value of $10,000, any major spending will have to be done through the banking system – keeping money in the banks.Whilst the Australian changes have been done to target money in the black-market economy, the IMF and other bodies certainly see benefit in such laws to prop up the banking system.This would bring consumers to a new (and unprecedented) situation. Do you pay a bank to hold your money, or go out spending? Would this create enough incentive to turnaround an economic downturn? The reality is no-one knows.What to doFirstly, it’s important to have a reality check here. Boom and Bust cycles are the norm, and investors that make decisions at the peak of either are rarely better off – it’s the long-term game plan that matters. Whether we see negative interest rates at this stage is entirely speculation!Secondly, it pays to review your current assets and investments. If you’re heavily invested in cash yet a long time off retirement or purchasing your first property, a market portfolio may be a more suitable investment. Such an investment remains liquid (it can be converted to cash relatively easily) and has outperformed cash dramatically over the past 10 years (look here to see the numbers).If you’d like to have a no obligations chat about your investment options and allocations, we are here to help!

Yet in February, Harcourts saw sales increase in the Wellington Region by 7%, Christchurch 6.3% and the South Island 2% whilst Barfoot & Thompson saw a 28% reduction in sales in Auckland. The New Zealand property market is acting in a localized fashion that we have not seen for several years, what’s driving these varying levels of performance?To understand, we need to break down the market between investment and residential. The NZ investment market is spooked. The looming prospect of a Capital Gains Tax that extends beyond the current five-year Bright Line test and new rental property standards for landlords, has resulted in both BNZ and Westpac increasing interest rates on those looking to purchase an investment property. The government is signaling just how serious it is with new rental standards, allowing tenants to receive up to $4,000 for reporting non-complying landlords. It should be noted however these standards still leave New Zealand below the rest of the world and such investment will more than likely be recouped in any sale of the property. The rate of landlords exiting the market is increasing.Movement in the residential market is purely down to the age-old issue of supply and demand. A lack of development has been felt particularly in the Wellington Region but is also impacting other areas within NZ. KiwiBuild is slated to bring 2,000 new properties to Porirua but with the first of these not due until 2020 (a big if on the current performance of the scheme) it is unlikely we will see any change to supply in a hurry. Meanwhile, the collapse of several high-profile New Zealand construction firms has the private building sector concerned and acting more cautiously than we have seen for years, limiting new development. Our Thoughts For investors, a better option right now may be to review your investments and consider stocks, bonds and other financial products as part of your personal wealth strategy. Rental income has been an easy ride for the average Kiwi investor over the last 30 years, but the market is only going to become more difficult.For those seeking to purchase their first house, low interest rates are fueling demand but this doesn’t mean you are priced out of the market.

What's Really Going On With The Soaring Insurance Costs?,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1708636199901-XPNXAHNLZJTWH8CASN88/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"Rising insurance costs is the hot topic of the moment - especially for homeowners. You've probably seen it splashed across the headlines, and maybe you've even felt the sting in your own wallet when that renewal notice hit your inbox. So, what's the deal with these skyrocketing premiums, and is there anything we can do about it? Buckle up as we break it down.Understanding the Ins and Outs of InsuranceLet's start with the basics. Picture this: insurance is like a giant money pool. You toss in your monthly premiums, and in return, the insurance company promises to bail you out if disaster strikes. Sounds simple, right? Well, not quite. See, recent natural disasters in New Zealand have drained that pool faster than you can say ""premium hike,"" leaving insurers scrambling to cover their backsides without breaking the bank. Enter the ReinsurersNow, to spread the risk a bit, insurers usually have a backup plan called reinsurers. These companies swoop in to help cover the costs when things get hairy. But with all the chaos happening in New Zealand lately, these reinsurers are starting to get a bit jittery. And you know what that means—higher costs for insurers, which, you guessed it, get passed on to us, the consumers.Facing the MusicSo, what's a homeowner to do when faced with a whopping 40% increase in insurance premiums? Well, it's tempting to throw up your hands and consider going insurance-free, right? Not so fast. While it might seem like a quick fix to save some cash, going without insurance is like playing Russian roulette with your finances. Trust us, you don't want to be caught without a safety net when disaster strikes. Finding Light at the End of the TunnelAlright, before you start panicking, there's a glimmer of hope on the horizon. As insurance pools start to refill and reinsurers get their act together, there's a chance—just a chance—that premiums might start to level off or even drop. But until then, it's all about staying informed, exploring your options, and maybe asking a few tough questions to make sure your insurance policy is working as hard for you as you are for it.There you have it. That’s the lowdown on rising insurance costs straight from the horse's mouth. It's a wild ride out there, but armed with a bit of knowledge and a healthy dose of skepticism, you'll be ready to tackle whatever the insurance world throws your way. Until next time, stay savvy and stay insured.",,"Thu, 22 Feb 2024 21:19:35 +0000",holly.jones@foxplan.nz
When do I need to start my retirement savings?,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579457582286-JETUJNK402MKAQFBM40Y/When%2Bdo%2BI%2Bneed%2Bto%2Bstart%2Bmy%2Bretirement%2Bsavings.jpg?format=original,"This week, FoxPlan financial adviser Richard Renfrew discusses when is the best time to start saving for retirement. Follow Richard on LinkedIn HERE.There will never be a better time to start saving for your retirement than today. What stops so many people however is that they make retirement saving an all or nothing concept – balancing your priorities is critical.Step oneThe first step is to have clarity of vision. What is it you want now and what do you want in the future? A lot of advisers will say save as much as you can – but your savings are unlikely to be sustainable if you take the ‘style’ out from your lifestyle. Ultimately, people need to have an enjoyable and sustainable lifestyle in order to continue saving.Compound interestNext, it’s important to understand the concept of compound interest. Was your Saturday night just past an $80 night out, or was it actually a $320 night out? When you save for retirement through a managed investment fund (such as KiwiSaver) you gain the benefits of compound interest. This means even taking tax into consideration, an investment yielding 12% will double your money every 10 years. If you have 20 years before retirement – every dollar you invest now will be worth $4 when you retire. Understanding compound interest makes you value things differently.A no brainer to improve our retirement is also to take advantage of your ‘free money’. These are funds you can leverage to grow your investment portfolios, such as employer and government KiwiSaver contributions.Bringing it togetherWhen we know what we want, understand the power of compound interest and are taking advantage of the savings benefits out there it then is about bringing it all together with a plan. Taking the time to plan exactly what you need in retirement and reviewing your position today.The earlier you start your plan, the easier it will be.If you’d like to talk more about planning, drop us an email at info@foxplan.nz.

Who guesses best – an intellectual or a chimpanzee,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579610858633-34MKTU2XLPECGLQWOPZM/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"“When asked simple questions about global trends – what percentage of the world’s population lives in poverty; why the world’s population is increasing; how many girls finish school – we systematically get the answers wrong. So wrong that a chimpanzee choosing answers at random will consistently outguess teachers, journalists, investment bankers, and Nobel Laureates.In “Factfulness”, professor of International Health and global TED phenomenon Hans Rosling offers a radical new explanation of why this happens.He reveals the 10 instincts that distort our perspective – from our tendency to divide the world into two camps (usually some version of us and them) to the way we consume media (where fear rules) to how we perceive progress (believing that most things are getting worse).Our problem is we don’t know what we don’t know, and even our guesses are informed by unconscious and predictable biases.”I thoroughly enjoyed reading (‘Factfulness’ – the stress–reducing habit of carrying only the opinions for which you have strong supporting facts).I recalled its message when reading, the recent joint report from the ‘Financial Markets authority’ and ‘Reserve Bank’ – Life Insurer Conduct and Culture findings from an FMA and RBNZ review of conduct and culture in NZ life insurers – Jan 2019.The FMA is reframing regulation and its ‘findings’ will inevitably influence legislation. NZ’s two main regulators of financial markets are the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) which focuses on conduct regulation of some financial market participants, and the Reserve Bank of NZ (RBNZ) which focuses on maintaining a sound and efficient financial system through prudential regulation.Attitudes towards the NZ life insurance market have undoubtedly been coloured by the recent Australian Royal Commission investigation into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry in Australia - and if the FMA, RBNZ or politicians don’t admit to being coloured – they have certainly been emboldened. This report smells of political backing.But are 279 interviews with staff of insurers, 29 financial advisers surveyed and insights sought from 4 insurance sector stakeholders (facts) sufficient to formulate a robust analysis from which to inform and advise.I doubt that the late Hans Rosling would have threatened his chimpanzees with that challenge, yet here we are taking journalist and political feedback in a very real lead up to legislative direction – who really has the conflict of interest?The basis for my taking the time to debate/discuss or attempt to counter the accusations of an incompletely informed media or political party – is not my 45 years in financial services, it is to question the growing socialist/left wing tendency to delegitimise capitalism. A debate at a more fundamental level. Of course my libertarian beliefs favour freedom – to choose, and to take personal responsibility. That does not make me an anarchist. The government has a legitimate role to protect its people from; danger, fraud, dishonest dealings. I have as much contempt for dishonesty at corporate level as I have at a political level or as I have at an individual level. But the more we coddle the less we educate. We cannot expect government to hold our hand through life. The more guarantee and certainty we demand the less freedom and choice we will have - ultimately. We have laws which protect the consumer – they are robust and practical but open to interpretation, as they should be. Principled as opposed to prescriptive.I quote – Eamon Butler, in his monograph. ‘An Introduction to Capitalism’.“Capitalism is usually seen as an economic way of life – about the creation and distribution of economic goods, not about moral or social outcomes. Yet it is in fact a social system – about human interaction on many levels.It is a highly moral system too. The human relationships in capitalism are not forced but voluntary. People, invest, create, supply, sell and buy things as they choose. No government ordains their actions: the decisions are theirs.Indeed, the only role for the power wielded by the state is to ensure that individuals are not forced – or robbed, defrauded, or otherwise violated.Capitalism is not based on commands, but on the rule of law in which general rules (such as honest dealing, honouring contracts and shunning violence) apply to everyone – including the government authorities.Yet like a game that also proceeds by following rules, capitalism does not guarantee any specific result. It cannot be blamed for the crimes or misfortunes of humankind. It does not promise enlightenment or equality. It does not even promise to enrich everyone (though in fact it does). But what capitalism does promise is to boost economic productivity – and boost it in ways that keep opportunities open to all, treat people equally and fairly, and reject fraud, coercion and violence.”My fear for a profession that I have participated in for most of my life is not; greater transparency, product simplicity or adviser qualification, - it is the unintended consequence which usually follows ‘well meaning’ government decree when that decree has followed poorly determined rationale driven by personal bias, misinformed practices or political agenda. History is littered with just such decision making.The life insurance industry distributes over $3.0 million per day to NZ families due to loss of life, loss of health or loss of income. The majority of which came about because someone sat around the kitchen table with that family and convinced them of the possible risks which could confront them. We should hear the applause around the country from parliament of that $1.2 billion per annum going back into our community from personal insurance claims. Sadly I suspect, that will not be the message from the pulpits of power or the keyboards of the media, understandable when considering the Hans Rosling message of factfulness – ‘The habit of carrying only the opinions for which you have strong supporting facts’.John KillickAFA, CFP, Life member MDRT The views and opinions expressed in this newsletter are not intended to be a personalised service for an individual retail client.

Why Passive Investing: Eugene Fama and The Efficient Market Hypothesis,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1614829437319-AVZH0I03E6A3WEGPYDRU/WW.png?format=original,"Last month, many of you would have heard about the happenings with GameStop – this newsletter isn’t going to delve too far into the details; there’s countless articles already online doing just that. Rather, this newsletter shall aim to expand on FoxPlan’s investment philosophy, looking at the fundamental theories which have led to our promotion of taking a passive stance on investments – using GameStop as an example to highlight the argument for passive investing.Fundamentally, a passive investment strategy is one in which you trust the markets, knowing that historically they have gone up, and having faith that such a trend will continue. A simple example of a passive investment strategy would be putting your funds into the NZ Stock Exchange Top 50 (NZX 50) shares or S&P 500 as a whole, rather than picking a few select companies. Through such a strategy, an investor can expect their return to match that of the market (minus fees).The alternative approach is actively picking and choosing stocks – ultimately speculating which stocks are likely to rise the most over the next quarter/year and putting additional funds towards those particular stocks. The objective for all active investors, whether they are individuals or large fund managers, is to try to outperform the market. Whilst this approach has historically been favoured, statistics and academic research prove asset allocation and index-based options outperform, and over the past two decades have led the smart money away from, active investment options.To understand why passive investment strategies consistently outperform active investment strategies, you could read in detail about the Efficient Market Hypothesis – a theory which is largely attributed to Eugene Fama. It suggests that stock prices reflect all available information – therefore active investors can theoretically only beat the market through insider knowledge or making speculative investments (picking a stock and praying it was the right one). So, whilst some active funds may achieve a degree of outperformance in the short-term, correctly guessing the right stocks over a 10,15 or even 20-year period is exceptionally unlikely.In addition to his work in developing the Efficient Market Hypothesis, Eugene Fama is also widely known for his empirical studies on asset pricing and active versus passive fund performance. Such research has validated his Hypothesis, as have more recent studies such as those by Morningstar (see link below – further reading). A clear insight from these studies is that the success rate of active funds dwindles lower and lower over longer timeframes.Please refer to the graphical depiction below of portfolios which maximize returns for the risk associated with them rather than picking individual stocks and hoping to get lucky. At FoxPlan, we primarily focus our clients towards investing into asset class index-based strategies utilising the wisdom of this academic research. So, how do the recent events surrounding GameStop exemplify the issues with active investing? Several large actively managed hedge funds lost billions due to their short-position (a bet on the direction they thought the stock price would move) on GameStop, whilst countless retail investors also lost varying amounts of money due to jumping on a short-lived bandwagon, right as the stock’s value plummeted back down. Essentially, what we saw happen could be compared to buying lotto tickets – gambling. Conversely, investing, which if done appropriately over a long period, can positively impact your wealth.One of the big downsides to what has happened with GameStop is that many of those who lost money may now be scared of losing again, and thus avoid investing in stocks for many years to come. They would thereby miss out on the real benefits of a diversified index-based strategy optimised for their particular goals.If you’re interested in learning more about the topics addressed in this newsletter, here are some links to get you started:Efficient Market HypothesisEfficient FrontierMorningstar 2020 ReportGameStop BreakdownIf you have any questions, or would like to discuss this further, please get in touch.Kind regards,Warwick Walker The views and opinions expressed in this article are not intended to be a personalised service for an individual retail client.

Your rights with a financial adviser,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db9d341bba34033898eef44/1579468896404-CITRVTKEG0ELJO2F31XR/image-asset.jpeg?format=original,"As of 15/03/2021, this article is now outdated due to the new rules and regulations which apply to the financial services industry. If you have any questions about the changes, we recommend visiting the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) website to learn more.The basis of all great relationships is trust and it should be no different when dealing with your financial adviser. Building that trust, however, isn’t always easy with the number of laws, regulations and titles given to different types of advisers within New Zealand.This week we have delved into the details to make it easier for you to understand your adviser and their obligations.Your adviser or their firm should be registeredIn New Zealand, all advisers are regulated by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA). Every business that provides financial services within NZ must be registered on the Financial Service Providers Register (FSPR) before they can legally provide financial services. Many individual advisers may also be required to be registered as well (this is not a requirement for Nominated Representatives or QFE advisers as they will belong to a Qualifying Financial Entity such as FoxPlan).Those with undischarged bankruptcy, banned directors or with financial crime convictions are unable to register as an adviser.Click here to check the FSPR.Adviser alignmentThere are three types of financial advisers within New Zealand and it’s critical to understand the differences between these as it can directly impact the financial advice given to you.QFE Advisers or Nominated Representatives are a common type of adviser within New Zealand and understanding their alignment is extremely important. If they are aligned only to their own organisation (such as an insurance company or bank), they can only provide products from that single organisation. If the organisation they are aligned to is able to deal with multiple providers, then they will be able to offer a market comparison in their advice.Our tip when dealing with a QFE Adviser or Nominated Representative is to ask which companies they work with to ensure you are getting multiple options.Registered Financial Advisers are the most common type of adviser in New Zealand. They can offer products across organisations as well as provide advice on some basic investment products such as KiwiSaver or term deposits. Usually, insurance and mortgage advisers will operate as an RFA.The third type of adviser is an Authorised Financial Adviser (AFA). These advisers are subject to tougher approval by the FMA and governed by higher levels of competency. AFA’s can deal with multiple providers and provide advice on all types of investment, insurance and other financial products.A disclosure statementAll advisers must provide you with a disclosure statement which outlines the services they provide. This statement should be provided without asking for it and especially before any advice or financial transaction takes place.AFA’s will also provide a secondary disclosure statement which outlines what fees they charge, commission or other incentives received and any other circumstances that could influence their advice or recommendations.How can I vet my adviser?There are several things you can do before dealing with a financial adviser to help feel at ease about their qualifications and competency:• Web presence: Does the adviser have a web presence such as LinkedIn, Facebook or Google Maps listing? These platforms allow two-way communication with the public and can make it easier to identify those with issues• Search for reviews: Check the reviews on these pages. Read the negative and the positive – if there are negative reviews, this may not write them off. Check if they have responded to the criticism and ask whether it is fair criticism in the first place• Ask for testimonials: Advisers with a track record should have clients that are all too happy to advocate for them• Ask around: Word of mouth is a very useful tool for evaluating the experiences of othersThe above list is by no means exhaustive. The single biggest tip we can impart, however: if you do not feel comfortable with your financial adviser – walk away.If you would like to arrange a time to discuss your circumstances with one of our financial advisers, please email info@foxplan.nz.
